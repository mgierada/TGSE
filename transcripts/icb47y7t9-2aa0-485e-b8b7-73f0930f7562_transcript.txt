You're listening to the skeptics guide to the universe your escape to reality. Hello. Welcome to the skeptics guide to the universe. Today is Wednesday, March three, Rd 2,021. And this is your host, Steven novella. Join me this week or Bob novella. Hey, everybody. Jane novella. Hey, guys. And Evan Bernstein. Good evening. Kara cannot join us this week because she is busy with some special class, but she'll be back next week and we missed the live stream on Friday because Yeah, that's too much going on. Even your tip in taxes. Yeah, I'm definitely taking part of the blame for that one. Yeah, I am neck deep in it. Plus, I had to wash my hair and stuff. Which one to Evan had to bail out the last minute, which we totally expect, like, there's, like, two to 3 months where Evan just has to be more on call. It's fine. Doesn't bother us. It's these six weeks. It's March, and the first two weeks of April is just there's nothing else in my life other than well, SGU and taxes and getting some sleep when I can. And really, that is it. I am not doing anything else. Then it was my wife 40 th birthday, so having both of us have to drop it would have been Bob and Steve. And then without even an all day. Steve, what's kind of show? We could handle it. Steve and I could handle. He disagreed. Yeah, I disagreed. So in case you were worried, everything was fine. We just life intrudes. The Friday live stream has been fun, but it's still kind of. We're just doing it on a whim. You know what I mean? It's not really built into our schedule. It's just if we can do it, we will to voluntary thing that we do. Yeah, I'm surprised we've been this consistent, but I love it. It's a great kick off for the weekend. Our intense conversations go back 30, years. How long have we known each other now? 19 92 is when I met you guys at April of 92 coming up on him for 30 years. But Dana, the fact that we do a three hour recording on Wednesday nights with each other, and then we jump on a live stream and just for an hour and a half you to breeze for another hour and a half. It's nothing like, Oh, my God. The wonderful thing about having people like this is you never run out of conversation. I mean, we did the 12 hour show, and it didn't seem like 12 hours to me a scratch in the surface. We over prepared like we normally do, but even that it really we could have, I think, easily gone another 12 hours as we did less than half of what we prepared. That's the good thing about doing a science show is that there's always signs the site is always changing, always new stuff to talk about. And speaking of which, we're just going to get right to our news items. We have a lot to get through. Actually, Jay, you're going to start by talking about Maxi. Nasa for the very first time, is going to try to use something outside of Earth as a resource. I briefly mentioned this instrument last week when I was talking about the perseverance Mars Rover, and it contains the Rover contains a new instrument that potentially could be one of the most profound events of the mission. And it's called Moxi. As Steve keeps. He just loves the word, right, don't you, Steve? Sure. It'd be a really cute nickname for a girlfriend. You know, it's a really cool word. So if successful, this mission will prove to be the beginning of being able to send astronauts home from Mars, and also in part, keep them alive. Now, I'm being vague deliberately because I'm filling your brain with secondary information. And then you'll see what I do. So at the size of a car battery, this gold colored prototype requires how much energy guys 3. 1, third of the Rovers energy one third of perseverance to energy gigawatts is going to this part. Now, like I said, this is not part of the Rover's primary mission. And when it performs its function, it's gonna run at 800 degrees Celsius or 1 472 degrees Fahrenheit. Guys, don't touch it so incredibly hot that the engineers had to use the best insulating material known to man to protect perseverance from it. I stands for Mars oxygen Insitu resource utilization experiment. So in its function is actually similar to that of a tree in that, it will intake carbon dioxide, which there's plenty of because the Mars atmosphere is literally co two. That is the atmosphere of Mars. So after its process is done, it'll output pure oxygen into the Martian atmosphere. And this is not for terraforming purposes. Although, my God, Bob, how cool would that be if we started terraforming Mars in the next 30 years? Like just try to change the atmosphere of Mars signed up a billion. Moxie is not gonna happen. Yeah. So, Jay, where does the carbon go? I'm going to tell you everything, Steve, but in my own way, in my way. Okay, so on future missions, the oxygen would be used for what? For fuel and breathing fuel and breathing. That's what oxygen is perfect for. So clearly, future astronauts will be depending on the future versions of Moxi. So, like I said, the Martian atmosphere, it's 100 times less dense than Earth. And that doesn't mean that there isn't a huge abundance of co two, because that's what it is. All the air that's there is co two and NASA plans on turning Moxi on about 12 times during the next two Earth years. And that should do it. That should be enough for engineers to be able to suss it all out. So what they are predicting is that it will produce between six and 10 grams of oxygen per hour, and that is enough oxygen to keep a small mammal like a skunk or a Fox or 22 low land streak. Teric, look it up. They're really cute. What the hell? Just look them up. They're cute as hell 22 of them. Yeah. Just going by body weight. We're testing it now to see if it successfully functions on Mars. Now, why couldn't they just test it on Earth? Well, the fact is, we did, but you have to keep in mind that Mars is dusty. It's very cold. 62 Celsius minus 81 Fahrenheit. So there's no predicting the ways that this thing can fail like any other device. So that's why we want to bring it to Mars and test it there. So when they turn it on for the first time, they're expecting that it's going to function. But you got to keep a couple of other things in mind that one Mars has dramatic temperature changes. The conditions can widely change just when the Sun sets, it can go down to minus 101 Celsius negative. 150 Fahrenheit that's cold. And this absolutely traumatic temperature change changes the density of the atmosphere. You could do this test on your own. You ever put a a balloon in a freezer? It shrinks. That's what the atmosphere does when it gets cold. So depending on the season on Mars, now, much of the atmosphere turns into dry ice. Actually, during the Martian winter, it literally falls from the Sky as dry ice crystals at the poles so that it's pretty great now that we have this device that we're going to test, and we're like, okay, Let's throw Mars at it and see if it works in the future, a Moxy device would have to be able to produce hundreds of times more oxygen. Of course, because why? Because we're just this tiny little prototype. But in order for it to really create fuel, like, Let's say we just wanted to, like, send a ship that we land that brought people. This is all a guestimation, but it would have to run. The larger version of this machine would have to run nonstop for a year to make enough oxygen to get a ship off of Mars. So that's one of these devices at size 100 times bigger than the current one hundreds of times bigger, by the way. So it pulls in Martian atmosphere through a filter, and it pressurizes it to one atmosphere. And then the pressurized co two is then Fed to a solid oxide electrolyzer where it electromagnetically changes the molecules at the cathode. Right. So the engineers say that this is equal to running a fuel cell in reverse, by the way, but the heat and the electricity split the co two molecule 1 interesting. Tidbit J is that it splits the co two into oxygen, but also carbon monoxide, and that's a high energy molecule that can be used as a precursor to make things like jet fuel, which could be handy to have on Mars for backup generators if nothing else. So another significant goal here is how to best run Moxy itself. It's not as simple as just you're not just turning it on light. It's this really incredibly nuanced series of events that needs to take place. If the heat and the electrical charge or not strong enough, co two molecules will make it through the machine. And if they run, it too weak, then the machine is going to be stripping off too many oxygen molecules. And if that happens, it'll create a lot of carbon atoms and carbon atoms would kill the machine because it would fill. It would sit. And this is also known as coking. So NASA will fine tune Moxy, literally by hand. Now, of course, via radio signal by hand. So they'll be turning the knobs to make sure that they're bringing in a certain amount of co two. And the heat is correct and the electrical charges correct. And that's how basically it works. I mean, it's using those two things to split up the co two molecule to get to the oxygen. At the very end of this machine, we will get oxygen and carbon monoxide, and it's going to push both of those two gases into the Martian atmosphere. Now, again, this is insignificant. It's not going to do anything on a big scale, but on a small scale, if we collect the oxygen, that's just as important as water. So Let's think about this. Nasa is testing a device that can literally prepare Mars for humans to go to Mars. Right. We'll drop one of these 1 10 20 of the big ones down. I have no idea how many that they're going to want to drop, but they'll get these devices to Mars. They'll probably have storage tanks that are already there to start the process, or they'll start doing the collection when the astronauts get there. I hope that some of this stuff would already be in place. Interestingly, there is a division at NASA, and its goal is to advance human exploration. So they have four questions that they need answered. They need to know all the details about Martian radiation. They also need to know about how to land a heavy spacecraft on Mars, which we have not done. They need to know all the ways that dust can interfere with equipment, and they need to figure out ways to take advantage of raw materials on Mars, so that will lighten the load of payload, right. We don't want to send oxygen to Mars when we can make it on Mars. We don't want to send water to Mars if we can collect water on Mars, so that's their job to figure all of those things out, the resources that are there that we can transform. Making oxygen on Mars guys is absolute requirement in order for sessions to begin. Right? Of course you can't ship it all there. So if things go well and enough data is gathered from this prototype NASA, they might be sending a fully scaled Moxy on a future mission. Not too soon. From now, NASA is indeed, already testing a larger prototype right now that can create more than two pounds of oxygen per hour. That's not bad. And what's the energy source for those devices going to be just solar. It's gonna be like a solar powered right now. It's the onboard energy that perseverance has in the solar collection. But they were saying that there has to be some type of reactor that they send there for electricity measure. You can't just collect solar on Mars. They're going to want some type of you could if you have a year. If you have years to do, it doesn't matter, sure, but I think having an instant source of energy is a hugely important thing. When you have people living on Mars, you can't solely use solar radiation and batteries like you're going to want something that's going to always be pumping out electricity. Some source with the radioactive decay nuclear. So I love this one because it's in the works. This is happening now. This is not happening in 10 years. This is literally on Mars right now. They're going to turn it on. It's going to spit out oxygen. Fingers crossed, but it's very likely to happen because they've already tested the hell out of it. So they are signaling. I mean, NASA, among others, this is manned missions to Mars in the future, and that I suppose they feel that robotics will only ever get us so far. Although otherwise, they would be making more perhaps investments in expanding the robotics of it all. I think they're going down both routes. We're sending Super complicated billion dollar robots to Mars. So we are sending robotics. There the idea, and then we just extrapolate. I think on what you're saying. Imagine if we take a Boston dynamics robot a future version of one of them or send 20 of them to Mars and have them start building living quarters. Living habitats have them start putting together machinery and all that. Yeah, that would be fantastic. But this is a clear sign that NASA is saying, and they are saying 25 to 30 years, that's their target number of where they want to prepare the Mars infrastructure so they could do it. And this is one quarter of the huge, unanswered questions that could be answered. This machine works, and they have a better version of it. And they're also talking about having the future versions of it be solely run by AI because it needs to be tweaked as it goes. This isn't like a baby. Yeah, it's not on this machine needs to be completely monitored and fully tweaked as it's running, I can't be like, Oh, it didn't do this right. You know, it has to happen on the fly. So AI is definitely the solution here. As long as it doesn't become conscious and then reprogram those Boston dynamics robots. And then they build a whole Mars colony that 15 years comes and kill us. It's gonna be awesome. No, but I am riveted to the perseverance mission, and especially this Moxy thing has totally piqued my my interest in curiosity, it's wonderful to think that oxygen is going to slowly trickle out onto Mars. Just totally is an it's given me the what do you call it? The habit. It's more like it made me feel like I did when I was like, 15 learning in this. Yeah, I just. Yeah, my nuts. But, you know, when you were a young kid and you started to get into space and you had that romantic feeling about space and space travel, it made me feel that again. So don't underestimate the value of the carbon monoxide that gets produced also, so carbon monoxide is a very high energy molecule. You combine that with hydrogen and you have jet fuel, you can have a hydrocarbon. And so this could be making oxygen to store in tanks and then also be if they want to, they might have to electrolyzed water to get more oxygen than they have the hydrogen. They combine that with the carbon monoxide, they have jet fuel. And now you have fuel and oxygen to combine with that fuel to burn it. The oxygen would also bootstrap any habitats until they're growing enough plant life to end. Then once they get the plant life going in the habitats that will make more oxygen than they just to breathe. But Yeah, this is really about the fuel. You obviously don't want to bring the fuel with you to Mars that you need to get back because it has a whole fuel equation. The rocket equation. You want to be able to go there and pretty much on empty and then just pick up your fuel for the return trip. That would be ideal. We take everything for granted on Earth. This is where following what NASA is doing. They don't. Nasa completely gets it. And they're saying we have to develop a machine that can do this. And they did. And I just find that so perfectly human. The innovation of humankind is so fantastic. There is a toaster sized battery sized machine on Mars that is converting the Martian atmosphere into oxygen. Oh, my God. So it's got going on solar. I think it's gonna run on solar. I mean, Let's through it. They're gonna send a selfcontained nuclear reactor or something to March. I don't think they're gonna do and I don't think the atmosphere is thick enough for wind turbines to be very efficient. They could send some of the newly designed nuclear reactor. Steve, the ones that they got 10. Kilowatts for one of those things. They're not very big. I don't know how automated is to actually set it up. How much human help do you need to set it up? But they're 10 kilowatts. Man, that's pretty decent. Daisy chained a bunch of them together. You got to plenty of power. Yeah, maybe that would be the power source for that. Astronauts too. They send you a absolutely. That's what it's designed for. That's what it's designed for. I would post on the moon eventually. Even Mars in my backyard. Solar collection on Mars takes longer because it's farther away. Sure. Yeah, Yeah. It's not as much power. All right, Let's move on. So not too long ago, I talked about the extinction of the megafauna in North America. And now, not too long after that, there was another news item talking about just the megafauna extinction worldwide. And coming back to this question is this question of how much is human activity responsible for the extinction of megafauna? In general? It doesn't necessarily mean that it's true in every single time in place. And maybe North America was an exception. Or not again, that's still controversial. But the authors here did a very interesting thing. They took an approach that was very reductionist, which I always love. They just said, Let's just look at the amount of energy you would have to expend in hunting. And the amount of are you would get back for your effort. How much calorie bang for the buck are you getting in hunting? And by their calculations, the bigger the animal you hunt, the more energy efficient it is, sure. And the more friends that die. Well, once you get to the point where you have tools like you can make spear points that are big enough to kill a large, Yeah, especially if they're ranked. And you have enough intelligence to hunt cooperatively. Once you get tip over that point where you could take that reliably take down big gain, then that becomes what you're doing. Now, I also will note just archaeologically that this also coincides with using fire to Cook the oldest evidence of cooking fires. And this is a home rectus. So at some point, home rectus started hunting big game and cooking their food. And when they did that, they spread throughout the world and that they were the first human ancestor to really do that. Probably partly because if you're going to be hunting big game, you need a large territory, right? Everybody can't be doing any are in place, but there's pressure to keep spreading out, keep spreading out. And they just spread throughout the world on times at the same time. Starting around that time, there's also been a consistent trend in the fossil record among mammals of decreasing average size. And it's been pretty consistent. Pretty much wherever people go, animals get smaller. And that correlation is pretty robust in the fossil record. And so what the new authors are saying is that the overkill I authors human pressure from hunting was a consistent, selective pressure against large body size. And so animals. The bigger animals were dying off basically makes sense. The other thing is, you don't have to kill every last member of a species in order to drive into extinction just as we do, just in pressure, adding that selective pressure stresses out species and just reduces their life expectancy, right their species lifetime. And generally speaking, biologists believe that once a population gets to less than 2 0, it's pretty much going to go extinct. Like the probability of going extinct approaches 100 as you get less than 2 0. Individuals genetically healthy, sustainable population is minimum about 2,000. So anyway, you isolate these populations, you reduce their numbers, you put this lector pressure n them, and then the big speech, you start going extinct. So what does this mean? This means that humans have to hunt smaller and smaller animals. They say this correlates with a dramatic increase in human brain size because it it takes a lot more brain power to hunt small game than a cool interest. They're faster, they're harder. And you may have to do trapping or more elaborate kind of procedures in order to get them. Whereas a big lumbering elephant, you just need the big weapon for a lot of people. It's more brute force, perhaps than real skill and cleverness. But then they said, buy their calculations as animals get smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller from hunting pressure. At some point, it's no longer worth it. Like at some point, you have to spend more energy hunting than you get out of the food. You can. Yeah, like when you start hunting bacteria. Well, fishing could be like that. You know, if you're spending all day fishing, one or 2 fish does not have a lot of calories in it, right? Until you get more modern techniques, net. And then they argue, this is kind of like a little bit of a one explanation for a lot of things happening. I'm always suspicious of those, but they argue that when the human civilization in general got to that point where we were getting diminishing returns on hunting because we were driving the bigger species into extinction. That is the point. When we switched over to agriculture and husbandry where we started raising animals, domesticating animals and growing crops because hunting was no longer sustainable for humans because we just killed all the big animals, basically. So you're so unhappy with the connection they made there? No, I just think it's a little simplistic, but it's pretty. I mean, it's probably not the whole story. There's a lot of complexity there, but the general idea, the diminishing returns of calories for effort as bigger animals decrease is I like that reasoning. I think it's probably a factor. Is that the only reason why we picked up agriculture? 14,000 years ago? Probably not, but, I mean, it may have been a contributing factor, so if dinosaurs were around, we never would have gotten smart. Well, probably not, but for other reasons, Yeah, it's interesting. So the thing is, if you look at the fossil evidence again, this is still a little controversial. This is not universally accepted among paleontologists, paleontologist. But the evidence I reviewed the evidence just as part of looking at this story. Where are we with this overkill hypothes globally? It seems to be pretty, pretty solid and it sounds like it's anything growing in popularity. So for example, I got North America. We go back to North America the average body size, the average weight of a mammal decreased from 216 pounds to just 17 pounds. Wow. And also you could look at it as what is the probability in the fossil record of a large species going extinct? It's between 101 0 times greater than the smaller species. The smaller mammals? Yeah, there's basically a dramatic orders of magnitude decrease in the average body size of mammals. If you look at any continents and over time over the last 125 0 years, definitely maybe one to 2,000,000 years. There's this consistent trend. Now, if you look at an alternative hypothesis which a scientists like to do and say, well, what if climate was killing off the bigger species because they'd have enough food or whatever to eat? The vegetation wasn't supporting bigger body size and humans were just hunting. What was there? They were just following this trend, not driving the trend. So what they looked at is the correlation between climate and body size of mammals. And you know what they found. But nothing. No correlation. Animals do not tend to get bigger or smaller because the average temperature is going up or going down. So absent the presence of humans, the climate does not have the same effect does not reduce body size over time. There's no correlation. So it's looking pretty good for humans being the decisive factor and killing off the megafauna makes sense sense to me. Yeah. And it's not just by hunting. By the way, hunting. You think of hunting again? That's sort of the simplistic notion. It's hunting, but it's also changing the habitat. That's right. Yeah. Driving them out of where they're able to breed and orderly producing everything burning down the forest so you can grow the plants that you like. I mean, it was not uncommon or just diverting water to your own. I mean, there's lots of ways in which humans change the environment, adding further pressures. You can also carry this forward from 14,000 years ago, 12,000 or so years ago when the advent of agriculture to the present and in fact, humans affecting the habitat of animals has been getting much, much worse. So now we've basically taken over half of the land. The non. I think ice covered land on the planet to grow our own food and for our own habitat. So you know the background extinction rate. If you look at just the history of the world, there's a pretty steady background extinction rate and it's about one species per million species per year, which makes sense. I mean, species on average, live about one to 2,000,000 years. So one species per million species per year. Go extinct as the background rate there's about 10,000,000 rounding it off 10,000,000 species on the planet so we would expect 10 species to go extinct every year. Just evolutionarily as the background rate. What do you think the current observed rate of extinctions are going a couple of orders of magnitude times 1,000 30,000 per year. We are so good at destroying things from 10 per year to 30,000 and that's mostly habitat loss. But now we could throw in climate change as well. Diversion of resources most calories in the world and how are going to humans. Most fresh water is going to humans. So of course, it's gonna be a huge pressure on every other animal. Oh, my gosh. Right. Wow. Yeah. So take it away and they will suffer many scientists. That's why they call what's happening right now. The sixth mass extinction. If you just look based upon the extinction rate, you can imagine far future paleontologist looking at the fossil record. Something happened here. You know, a lot of species went extinct that over this period of time. We are. Steve, do we have any information about ocean dwelling creatures and the impact we're having on that? Yeah, it's really bad as well. This research is focusing on land mammals specifically, but it's also true of the ocean as well. So, Yeah. I mean, I don't like to think of humanity as a blight or a disease or an infestation. That's a very negative view. Listen, people do what we do. This is the way we evolve. This is how we develop. These are the strategies we develop a life and murder. Horner. Murder. Horners. Do what they do. People are doing what they do, but I do think we are a species that can pick our head up and go, should we be doing this? Is this in our long term best interest? Is this the way we want to change the world? We'll do that when murder Horners do it. I think you're even underplaying man's awareness. We know what's going on. No, I'm saying as a species, we have a tremendous amount of power to alter the planet. But we also have the awareness to think about what we want to do and whether it's right or whether it's in our own interest, even long term. And it's hard marshaling the political will to change. What we're doing is proving to be impossible, really difficult. But I think that again the forces of within our civilization who have the awareness and the will, whatever to think carefully. Mainly scientists have to say who look around and say, we probably shouldn't destroy our environment and dramatically change the climate. And you'd be so resource intensive and everything that we do if we want to preserve the natural world, which I think we do, I certainly do. I think nature is wonderful and would love to preserve it as much as possible. And if you pulled people of that question, regardless of political affiliation or anything else. I believe you'd see a majority of people agree with you. It's true though. I've absolutely seen multiple different surveys where they ask people, do you want to prevent climate change? You want to preserve habitats? And do you want to prevent species from going extinct? And everybody says Yes? And then you ask them, would you do this one sacrifice to do it? And they say no. And so it's like everyone wants to do it as long as they don't personally have to make a sacrifice. So that's why we keep doing what we're doing. But if we look for if again, we don't necessarily have to make big self sacrifices, we may be able to just do things a lot smarter than we are, right? Yeah. We could use all the energy we're using. But Let's just do as much green energy as possible. Like, for example, you don't have to not use energy. Let's just use energy that has a smaller footprint on this planet. And Yeah, we should grow the food we need to grow. But we could do it with 20% less land than we're currently using that. Let's do that. Whatever. There's all kinds of things we could just do things smarter. And I don't think we're approaching 8,000,000,000 people on this. We just don't have the room anymore than we used to. We need to be smarter about how we about our footprint on this planet. If we want to keep it a good place to live, there's no other place out there. Even as much as exciting as Mars is. Mars really sucks compared to the Earth. I mean, it is very inhospitable. There is no place we know of in this universe that is anywhere near as hospitable as Earth. And it's also really hard to get anywhere else. So. Yeah, that's a big sheet problem. Yeah, I know this is kind of a Carl Sagan kind of a thought to have. So we just better take care of this one planet that we have, which we're not doing. The bottom line is, we're not doing it. We're bad. Stewart. Yeah, totally. Alright. And Bob, to top it all off, Earth is losing its own oxygen atmosphere. Come on. Wow. What? Yeah, it's true. It seems that way. Anyway. Nasa researchers have run simulations recently that showed the oxygen in Earth's atmosphere could be gone in. Guess how many years? Steve, you've probably read the exact to. Oh, gosh. When Earth loses its oxygen. Quintillion years. How many years? Well, how many years? Come on, keep. I know the answer. I don't want to say it. All right. Too long. A billion years. A billion years, you know, seems like a long time, but don't continue putting stuff off because you know what's happening. So this is from researchers from Toho University and NASA Nexus for exoplanet system science. I like the sound of that. They published a paper in the Journal nature Geoscience and this is Kazumi Ozaki and Christopher Reinhard. Now we think of the Earth as an oxygen rich world and it is and it has been for a while but it wasn't always such and it won't always be. There was an event in Earth's history called the great oxygenation event and this started about two and a half billion years ago with the cyanobacteria producing molecular oxygen for the first time you've got this being produced and that, of course, eventually gave rise to multicellular life that then took advantage of the oxygen because oxygen is awesome it's extremely reactive. It can form compounds with most of the stuff on the periodic table and released energy when it does it. It's just wonderful. I like it. Do you like it? Yeah, right. I love it, man, such an occurrence seems to absolutely require a really Grand name, right? Like the great oxygenation event. That sounds like a good name for that. The other common names, though, that I came across for it are awesome because they reflect a perspective that seems to come from the losing side of the great oxygenation event the ones that don't write the history, namely those organisms for which oxygen was poison and there were plenty of anaerobic oxygens were poisoned by this oxygen and died out the other names for the great oxygenation event that I came across are the oxygen revolution, the oxygen catastrophe which I like the oxygen crisis and even the oxygen Holocaust. Yeah, that one seems a little bit extreme, but Yeah, so it depends how you look at it, right? Because this was a world changing event that did take time now the level of this killer oxygen was probably small for a long, long time so long in fact that some people think that it's only in the past 400,000,000 years with the rise of land plants that oxygen reached the levels that we have today in fact, for a while that was actually greater, it was instead of 23 or 24% is like what? 28% or so not 21 it was 24 okay and that's why back then, they had gargantuan bugs. They'd dragonflies that were like, many times bigger than anything we have today that must have been really cool to see so it's easy to think then that oxygen went out right oxygen one. And it's going to stay that way until the Sun just expands and Burns as to a crisp that's not really 5,000,000,000 years Yeah, because it's how much longer the Sun go but that's not true it's going to be a lot sooner than that but it's hard to pin down a really solid time frame in the deep future when Earth's oxygen levels are going to suffer an event one way or the other worthy of putting down the event in your Google calendar and so this is what the two researchers were trying to determine when is what's going to happen and when they did this by combining biogeochemistry and a climate model to make an interesting simulation of the Earth. So they ran this simulation about 400 0 times, which, Oh, boy, I'm sure I'm hoping that was automated, but my guess is that they had a lot of free time in the pandemic. So they ran it 400 0 times. Of course, tweaking and changing parameters here. And there just because you can't know for certain what every parameter needs to be for a perfect simulation, of course. So you change the parameters for all the reasonable settings just to get a broad idea of what the range of possibility is with higher confidence. So once they did all that, their big picture conclusion was that Earth will lose most of it oxygen in its atmosphere fairly quickly within a billion years. Give or take a few weeks. No, I mean, sorry. Give or take 140,000,000 years. One way or the other. It can be expressed in with this pretty much. And of course, it ultimately does. This is going to happen because of the Sun. Damn you Sol. The intense heat on the Earth, though, is what's going to cause this to happen. Because the Sun is going to expand. It's going to get a lot harder in town, and it just basically starts a chain reaction of really nasty events. Each of them probably deserving their own Grand name. So first, you have the carbon dioxide levels will go down. And that's because the heat, the carbon dioxide will absorb this greater heat, and it's going to actually cause it to break down. Oh, finally, a solution for global. There you go. And then the warmer the air, the more that certain rocks like limestone, chemical weathering happens. And it pulls in more amounts of the oxygen in the atmosphere. So basically taking out oxygen in the atmosphere that's going to increase. And then the upper atmosphere is going to change because the upper atmosphere is now absorbing all of this heat energy from the Sun. So that will increase the kinetic energy of the atoms and molecules in the upper atmosphere. Because oxygen oxygen molecules are lightweight, they're just going to Dart off into space as they get increased kinetic energy. So we're going to lose oxygen that way as well. And then kind of the other side of the coin. Here, you've got the heavier molecules like methane. They're going to stick around because they're not going to get enough kinetic energy to leave the planet. So they're going to be relatively more abundant as time goes on. So all this is happening. But the CUDA grass, though, is really the decrease in carbon oxide because of that algae and land plants will start feeling the pain. They're going to start feeling it. And they're going to reduce oxygen production not good. It's already decreasing. Right. So then you're going to start reducing this free oxygen production, which is really the only source of it in the world is this algae and land plants. So they calculated that over 10,000 years, carbon dioxide levels will go so low that the plants will die off 10,000 years. No more plants in a billion years. But the interval where it gets real bad, it's going to be relatively brief. And then, of course, with the plant's gone, the animals, the plant eaters are going to go. And then the animals that eat the plant eaters, they're going to go not good. That's a chain reaction. So this is what they're talking about. This is going to be very similar to the early Earth when it was just like, it's going to be the methane and nitrogen and some other nasty gases that are inimical to aerobic life. It's gonna be bad. It's gonna be like early Earth. Yeah. Can I ask you a question? Why did science fiction movies so accurately predict all this crap? Why did they. Yeah, it's like I've seen this movie. You know what I mean? Let's get to the fix already. Oh, Yeah? Yeah. There's not going to be any suggested fixes here, Gerald. Maybe we can discuss them when I'm done. I've only got two more sentences, so I'm sure that we're gonna have a good name for this. We're gonna probably call this the greatly egregious deoxygenation catastrophe. We're gonna come up with something really Grand, assuming, of course, we're even live, which we won't be in a billion years. Nothing human like anyway. But I think, though, I think, though, that in a couple of billion years, though, if complex and aerobic life somehow develops, don't bet any money on it. But if it's somehow developed, they will call it the great methanogen ation event. They'll come up with a really nice word. So. Yeah. Nation. So enjoy the oxygen while you can. Bob, they won't have lips to even talk with. Who knows what they'll have. They'll express it in some electro Matic Vermeer way they'll be breathing methane in and out or nitrogen or something else. Interesting, though. Yeah. You think? Oh, we got 5,000,000,000 more years left because that's when the Sun is going to get really no. Like, no, things are going to get worse. And I've heard estimates that say, it's going to get pretty bad even well before that too. I've heard numbers like, in the hundreds of millions of years. Scientists also predict that with the Sun getting warmer and also the oceans, the subduction zones, they actually could drag down underneath across that in 1 1,000,000,000 years, the oceans will be gone. Yeah, there won't be any free water on the surface. And that's. That's when life was really going to have a hard time. But we kind of started with bacteria and archaea. And we're going to probably end that way. It'd be cool, though, to see what kind of area and bacteria develop with another couple billion years of evolution. It's gonna be all theirs again. And all theirs are we already just accepting the fact that humans are going to be dead. It's all very dark to me. Well, the average life span of a species about two to 3,000,000 years. If you go by averages, we're not going to last that long, but plenty of species lasted far longer than that. But we're a wildcard. We're a wildcard. Who knows? We start spreading throughout the solar system and then our area of the Galaxy. We could last for millions of years. Or we could be gone in a few weeks. Who the hell knows? Oh, my God. Who really knows? Steve, what do you have to say about all this? Well, sometimes you have to know when. Just to end the conversation. Okay. Very good. Right, Evan? Well, a nice segue. Steve, nice, scientifically speaking. Yes. Have you ever been? I'm asking you guys, have you ever been in a conversation and you want for it to end? But you can't really find a good way to end it. Yeah, I think we're safe to say we perhaps all been in n that? Sure. I just say I can't hear your static. I hoped you are. Oh, my God. Just being your face to face the seven, right. Remember that, Bob? Back in 2,019 of expensive to my mind. Those were the days. So when you engage in conversation with another person, we are talking face to face. Although we are also talking in other means as well, which I'll get to. But sometimes that other person in the conversation that you're talking to, I might speak too long. It might be, in fact, blathering. Sometimes the other person is dull or boring. They just have very little to say that you find interesting or your mind may be perhaps wanders to another topic. You see someone else across the room that maybe you'd rather be talking to at that moment. We've all been there right now on the necessary tangents and unnecessary detail. That detail is not important. Please be more concise. Exactly. Exactly. But, Bob, on the other hand, that never happens to you, right? I mean, it's always the other person. Of course. Of course. Everything you you say, Bob, is poignant. It's interesting. It's on topic. It's engaging. It's relative definition. I'm Bob. Not so fast. The other person in the conversation that you're speaking with when listening to the things that you have to say, they might find that you're the one speaking too long. Perhaps, Bob, you're blathering or what you have to say creating. I know that never happens to ourselves. Right? But there's even something that's more powerful, I'd say than disinterested participants in a conversation. And that's a force of social nature that sort of overtakes our ability to end a conversation. Most people do not want to come off as Im plate by ending a conversation that has not reached a natural conclusion. And there are many social cues that people give off letting others know when the conversation has run its course. Now, culturally speaking, at least in America which is my frame of reference. It's considered rude if I were to in the middle of conversation. And I don't want this to go on anymore, I would say, Yeah, that's whatever you were talking about for you or even worse, what if I would say, Oh, that's interesting. I have to go away now. Yeah, but Jay perhaps deter from sorry. Nice pockets said it plainly and most directly when he would say to his talk show guests, you've grown. Tis. Oh, my God. In them off in the middle of whatever it was they were talking about. And then, of course, there's the other end of the spectrum where you've experienced in conversations that seem to end prematurely. And perhaps that's left us feeling dissatisfied, or maybe even a little bit hurt inside. Well, a scientific paper which has been five years in the making, has sort of confirmed our fears that people often feel trapped in conversation with the feeling of no easy way to end a conversation. When they wanted to end, the paper appeared in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, lead researcher Adam Mastriani and his team. They begin. And the research when he was studying for his master's degree at Oxford, and he's now a PhD student in psychology at Harvard University. He and his colleagues invited groups of strangers 252 of them specifically into their laboratory, and they paired them up to par pairs of people one on 1 for a chat, and they were allowed to chat as long as they wanted for at least one minute and a maximum of 45 minutes. And the volunteers, they were told that they didn't have to spend the full time on the conversation that they could pretty much do what they want. Talk about what you want for as long as you want. So the people were paired up, the idle chat began. You know, they were talking about things like, where did you grow up or what they were studying? So apparently a lot of these people were other students to some degree. A lot of the conversations, according to the researchers were so boring that it became hard to watch them. So if you're a third person observing these conversations and you think it's for and who knows what the people in the conversation are thinking? So afterwards, the researchers asked the participants, how did they gauge their experience so of 126? Conversations that occurred? 2% ended when both parties wanted them to end, and this figure is remarkably stable, they said, irrespective of whether you're talking to a stranger or someone you're familiar with. Now, the authors of the study believe that this discrepancy is the result of a coordination problem. It's called arising because people tend to hide their true desires, including when they want a conversation to end. And it's an effort to avoid being rude. The results suggest that many conversations overrun for the sake of politeness and social solidarity, reaching a compromise that may suit neither party, but which crucially and admirably avoids offense. So think about it this way. According to the study 98% of our conversations and unskilfully reaching an unsatisfying conclusion, either too early or too late or one or both parties. Yeah, I honestly don't feel that at all. I feel conversationally like I've gotten to the point where I can really shift the conversation comfortably where I needed to go. And I do agree with you. E. There's me and agree with you. This is the research. I agree with the research that there's a lot of unconscious things that happen in ways of talking cadence, probably even the way you breathe and all that stuff that are completely unconscious, cues that we give out and receive and all that hundreds of cues. They said there's, like, a catalog of hundreds of social cues as part of the conversation phenomenon that takes place. They say it's extremely complicated. Yeah. I mean, I just feel like we do it so unconsciously. I am not conscious of it. I know a lot of people are, but I'm not because my brain is already just making it happen on its own. Yeah, absolutely. From my perspective. And I sort of have come to understand this a little more since I've been doing tax work. And when I am sitting in my office and having a one on 1 conversation with a person about their taxes, I'm very aware of their mannerisms and their level of either comfortableness or uncomfortableness. And there's a lot of people who come into the office very uncomfortable. They hate this. It's like going to a dentist for them. They fidget. You can see it in their eyes. You can see it just in their mannerisms. They hate being there. It's way too painful experience for them, so I absolutely, definitely see it. And I try to modulate myself or change my behavior based on the signals that they are sending out. And I do try to not make things go unnecessarily long. I do try to limit their uncomfortableness. Yeah, there's a lot of context there. Obviously, if you have an intimate relationship, somebody, you learn how to manage that better than a cocktail party where you're just chatting with somebody, you know, very superficially, or there are situations where there's a power differential or just there's some kind of structure in place. Like when I'm seeing a patient, and it's time for the encounter to end, it ends. But sometimes it does drag on. But there are mechanisms where you can just structurally end the encounter when it is over. Like, for example, I might say, all right, Let's move on to the next item, and then we do that's exactly what they report. So they say the words anyway. And all right, those are two very common. I got one guy Telegraph to. I got one of those transition words ready? Well, Steve, they ran another experiment in which they used crowdsourcing platform mechanical. Turk. I've never heard of it and they surveyed. Yeah. Mechanical Turk. Yeah. It's the thing where it learns from each encounter. It's like there's one where I think of any person living dead, real or fictitious. And it will ask you questions. And then guess who that person is. And it's remarkably powerful. But that's because after it does it a million times it gets really good at asking questions and predicting who you're thinking about. They surveyed a bunch of people on that platform and they say that a lot of people in that platform have conversations with family and friends. So there's the familiarity and the numbers seem to hold true. They get similar results that the majority of people feel like the conversation and did too quickly or was too short or in some ways that came to an unsatisfying conclusion for both parties. Yeah, well you think about it. What's the probability that you and the person you're talking to have exactly the same desire for the conversation to end at the same moment. Right? Hard to. If there's any difference, then both it'll go on too long for one and 2 short for the other. This is reportedly the first study to put numbers on how difficult it is for people to balance their own goals with what their conversational partners want. They say that the disconnect between what people wanted and what their partners thought they wanted is considered an important finding. So that's why this paper is being talked about a lot and getting a lot of news and they said that the work is consistent with other prior research that suggests that people are generally less skilled than we might imagine at working out what other people think. So there's your takeaway trying to better gauge what other people are thinking. Okay Jay, it's who's that noisy time? Alright guys. Last week I played this noisy. What is it? One thing only I got that on two pings only. Any guesses, guys? I mean the pings kind of reminded me of sonar in a way. But I doubt that's it. I don't know what that bubbling sort of noise was. Yeah, well it's funny. It's so funny how some people can key in on different aspects of the noise and I get people that write in and they nail like one of the noises that's inside of a noisy say like those bubbles or a lot of people would guess even when there's background noises, people will pick out details that I didn't hear. I'm like, Oh, you're right. There is a frog croaking in the background. That's interesting that you said that. Well, okay. So first before I get in, let me say that I made a mistake last week that I moderately embarrassed about. And I had a couple of people email me saying that I didn't get Ben Bert's name. Correct. Now Ben Bert is the sound engineer who did. All of the story was sound effect. A lightsaber. It's Ben Burt. What did you say? I confused Ben with bill Burr, but I mixed their names. I think he said, Ben Bur. I think that's Yeah, bill Burr is the comedian. Ben Bert is the is the sound engineer. And I mixed the two names, and I said something like Ben Berg or whatever. So I'm sorry to fans of both of those people. I'm sorry to those people as individuals, and I hate myself. No, but the thing that I don't like is that I didn't remember Ben Bert's name off the top because I idolize his sound effects. I mean, he came up with R two D-2-R two D 2 is actually his voice. Oh, wait. I mean, Yeah, he voiced those vocalizations, so anyway, two different people mixed them up. They're both great and both associated with star Wars, by the way. Yeah. Jay, you lose one geek point. I know, I know, Steve. You officially deduct it, and you can earn it back. But just hear me. You have to work for it. Anything that you could do to me, I did 10 times worse to myself. Trust me, I was like, Oh, my God. What's happening to me? All right, we had a listener named Michael wood, right? And say, Hi, Jay. This is just a complete guess. Is it the noise that an airplane flight recorder makes to help people find it. I heard water noises, and that's where my brain went straight to. I think this is a really cool I think that those black boxes, which happen to be Orange. By the way, send a radio signal. I don't think that they're sending those types of signals. And I don't want to give it away until I reveal the whole thing. But that's a cool guess. The next listeners name was Dan Lee and Dan said, dear J. It's a hydrophone or a microphone recording a piece of metal being struck and dipped in water. And then he said, I once saw a jazz drummer do this with a microphone and a bucket of water and a metal disk on a string. So, no, that's not it. That's cool. I've never heard that. So I can't say how much it resembles that sound. And I think it's very interesting that someone use this type of sound for music. Very interesting. That was not it, though. And then every once in a while to to my Roman warrior, I don't know who or what this guy looks like, but I think I just love his name. He said, assuming it's a citation, I'll say it's a or a purpose. A purpose on purpose. I did it on purpose. The veritable bottlenose dolphin of sonar to produce such echolocation. Really cool. Guess not. Correct. But I really liked it because mammals do make some types of noises like that. So Here's the winner from last week, Jonathan Tindell said, Jay, is this what a submarines active sonar Ping. Sounds like? I was heard by diver will underwater. Yes, you are correct. It was solar. There go, it was sonar. Yeah. And it was a scuba diver. I deliberately picked this one because Kara said, can you please just pick something? That is the thing? And now it doesn't completely sound like the sonar we're used to, because that's what it sounds like underwater number one. And the number two response to this is because the sonar you here in the movies is fake. And that way, just like so many, you're not hearing a bald Eagle. You're hearing a Hawk scream in the movies, in the movie? That's not sonar, which I hate because I'm programmed by people in Hollywood. But I know, right? That's it. That's not the one that a bald Eagle makes. That is a red tailed Hawk. But that's the sound they play whenever a Raptor flies by. Next thing you'll tell me that the enterprise doesn't make all that noise in space. But at some point, and this is why I found it fascinating to bring up Ben Burt because he made all these sound effects that we have. You know, most of us are aware of. And some of us have fallen in love with in the star Wars movies. So you have all the lightsaber and all that stuff. These sound effects sink in to our collective consciousness, and they're cultural, right? Because I'm sure the same sound effects some are shared around the world. But I'm sure that there's different ones for different cultures. If any listener has an example of this, please let me know. I'm fascinated by that. But they shape our world, too. Because when I hear that fake movie Eagle sound, it is so Eagle. To me, it is an Eagle in my brain, sunk it all the way down to my lizard brain that Eagle sounds like. And it's wrong, right? Correct. And it's interesting to hear Steve kind of not like that either, because our reality is partly being shaped largely, I would say by the media that we can. But what gets me, though, is that many, many times on some level, somebody involved in making that TV show with that movie or whatever decides, I'm gonna use the wrong noise because that's the noise people associate with this thing. You know, it's like we're using a language with the viewer, even though it's wrong. But it's been developed. Steve, it is a legitimate language because it actually does successfully communicate the things that they want to. That's the art official, but it's also a bit self fulfilling. Why can't you could change it, though, if you had the courage to do so, right? Sure. Yeah. But, I mean, it's the difference between taking a risk or you gotta think like they use the Willhelm screen because it's an effective scream. And as much as like that. But that's how consequential stuff. I like it when movies go meta, when movies point out the trope and correct it, you know. Yeah, Yeah, I agree with you. I've seen examples like the person in the movie is all is confused over the trope. What's that noise? That's not a submarine. I thought they sounded like this. That's in the movies. You know, I love that is so I would totally do that. Can't believe everything you see in Hollywood. Hey, guys, how about the nerve of a sound person to say, well, that's just in the movies. And they don't use the real sound they use yet another fake sound plan. A prank on us. Oh, boy. But this is a fascinating topic, because it goes very deep. It's not a shallow pool of things like so many things are not what they seem. Not the sounds that you think it is not the flavor that you you know, it's just all these things have been Fed to us. That's why skepticism. And it's the only thing that sharpens the glass that you look through. You know, by the way, that was sent in by Charlie Ross. Thank you, Charlie, very much. Charlie is a friend of the show. He's a patron and just a great guy. Every time I bring him up, I smile because he's a really good guy. Anyway, Let's go on to the new noise. This week. This noise he was sent in by a listener named Marcus Joe Hanson. And I gotta say that Marcus. Then I sent them an email back, and he said, I've been a listener for a few weeks now, and I can't really stress how much I enjoy. Who's that noisy. Even though I've only gotten it right once. It was the Lala dog, and it always cracks me up. That freaking Lala dog has connected me with so many listeners. I can tell you because if anybody I don't know, Bob, there must be people that like it, but didn't tell me, but it just seems to me, like every week somebody's like, Oh, Here's a noisy Oh, my God. That Lala dog. That is the best damn noise. Somebody throws a comment at me about it. That's the noisy man. That is the noisy of all noises. I think. La La La La La La. Oh, my God. Still correct for me. All right, so what? Our people missed it, and they're like, what are they talking about? How do they find that video? What do they search? We. I love the internet. Just type in La La La. That's it. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, dog. Let's see what comes up. And there it is. It's actually at the. Well, wait, now, you know, Google changes for every person. It's at the top of my Google course, it might not be for yours, but you'll see a really weird looking dog Press the play button. And if that's what you see, because it's very funny. Okay, so Mark is sent in an awesome noisy. I'm going to play for you right now. My first thought was something about the balafon from forbidden planet or some sound hack in that movie. We are hardwired as brothers together. I knew exactly when in the movie it's the music. It was actually the music when the creature is invisible walking on the ship and you're hearing, I guess that's supposed to be the noises of the ship or the music, but Yeah, totally. All right. It's really just a background scifi noise. That's really all it is. All right, so, guys, if you think you know what this noise is, please email me. And if you also heard something really cool like that noisy, I just played. You can email me at WT at the skeptic Sky org. Thank you, Jay. One quick question. The sweetest one comes from Eric from Omaha, Nebraska, and Eric writes, I'm no expert, but I smell bullshit. He's referring to transcranial magnetic stimulation and depression. And then he writes, always love the show. Thank you. So what do you guys think? Tms transcranial magnetic stimulation as a treatment for depression? Bullshit or reasonable? I say definitely reasonable for sure. Heard I've read too many good things about that, too. Yeah, I think. Have we actually talked about magnetic fields? Yeah, we've talked about TMS before, so Here's the thing. And the reason why I wanted to answer Eric's email is that there's so much magnetism based health quackery and pseudoscience out there that it does give you this knee jerk reaction that any intervention that claims to work through magnetic fields is bullshit till proven otherwise. That's not a bad heuristic. It's a good first approximation, but you can't stop there because there are legitimate electromagnetic treatments in medicine and this is one of them. Tms is a perfectly legitimate treatment for major depression. This is called neuromodulation. There's a number of treatments that count as neuromodulation. They include electroconvulsive therapy. Remember that going back to the 50 s 40 s. What is that? One floor with the coupes ness? Transcranial stimulation. Vegas nerve stimulation. Right. Those are the three that are currently reasonably Evans based in use of those. The most effective is electroconvulsive therapy, but it also has the worst side effects. Cognitive and cardiovascular. Really, I keep to evolving the procedure to get less and less severe so that the side effects or less. It's like, how gently can we do this and still get the benefits without causing the horrible side effects? And so that's evolved quite a bit over the last 20 30 years and then transcranial magnetic stimulation really is just a continuation of that process. Can we get the same effect without even really causing a seizure or using an electric shock just by using a magnetic field that was more focused and the answer is Yes. But TMS is not as effective as ECT. It's still effective. It's definitely effective for depression, but there's two populations of particular interest. One is treatment resistant depression. People who have depression that is resistant to medication or talk therapy. That is the population where ECT is mainly used treatment resistant depression, but also in psychotic depression because it's like the very, very severe form and also in depression and the elderly because they have a lot of difficulty with medication. So those would be three populations where it would be nice if we could have a neuromodulation approach. And again, ECT is effective, but it's kind of heavy handed. So we have TMS and also Vegas nurse stimulation. And there's a lot of new ones being developed. There is electrically administered seizure therapy, transcutaneous, vagal, nerve stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation as well as deep brain stimulation. So these are all promising new treatments for depression. Dbs deep brain stimulation is proven therapy for other things like neurological stuff, movement disorders, ET cetera. So this is all part of this new paradigm of neurological neuropsychological treatments where the brain is an electrical organ. The signals are electrical, and so we could use electrical or magnetic fields in order to modulate brain functioned. Why wouldn't that work? Pharmacological modulation is actually pretty crude by comparison, it's a chemical modulation, right? Yeah, it's a brain electrochemical. Yeah, exactly. Or just biological, it could just be biological manipulation not dependent on the specific functionality of the brain, but Yeah, nothing that affects neurotransmitters is neurotransmitter, neurochemical modulation, and that's inherently limited by evolution by how specific the receptors are and the distribution of those neurotransmitters and the receptor subtypes, ET cetera. You can't get more focused more specific than the brain is. So there's a lot of off target effects when you're using chemical modulation in the brain just because of that fact. But with neuromodulation, it's only limited by our technology. We could stimulate one neuron. If we had precise enough technology, there is no inherent limit, which is why I think as this technology advances, it's going to be a pretty exciting field for the future. We're still really in its infancy. There are proven therapies approved. Therapies TMS for depression is actually one of them, but we've got a long way to go in terms of really dialing in this technology. Literally. Where do you see it? Steve, where do you see it? In, like, 20 30 years. Give me some advance application. It's hard to say because you don't know what the especially clinically because you don't know what the ultimate clinical effects are going to be, but I think absolutely we will be using electrical nerve stimulator using some kind of neuromodulation, electrical and magnetic neuromodulation for. I think any movement, sort of, certainly for seizures, basically stopping seizures in their tracks, I think, is a likely application already. There's some research there and anything affecting mood perception, even cognition by there's a lot of potential there. Imagine that. Okay, we're going to do a name that logical fallacy also this week. So this email comes from Jeffrey from California and he writes, how I love the show. I've listening. For years, I want a hard copy and a digital copy of the book, and I recently became a patron. Thank you, Jeffrey. Thanks, man. I recently noticed a common, logical fallacy that I can't make fit into the logical fallacies you have defined. I call it the election fallacy. So listen to this, guys, and you tell me what you think is going on here. This is actually a little complicated. Here's an example of how the election fallacy plays out. I love hummingbirds. They sparkle like flying jewelry. And they're a miracle of nature. A candidate for governor Janet humming also loves hummingbirds and proposes making the humming bird. The California state bird. As part of her election platform, a new governor gets elected. And sadly for me, Janet humming lost the election. My conclusion. Here's the fallacy. Everyone who voted for the winning candidate hates hummingbirds and wants the Quail to remain the California state bird. I've seen this is all fake. By the way, this is the hypothetical. I've seen this play out a lot in politics lately. I think many people who succumb to this fallacy fail to realize that most people probably agree with them, who doesn't think hummingbirds are cool. It was a difference of priority, not principle that led others to vote for the other candidate. They may have wanted to see the Hummingbird become the state bird, too. But they considered other issues to be more important when choosing a candidate. So what is the logical fallacy of assuming that someone who voted against the candidate whose pro Hummingbird must hate humming birds? It's not hasty. Generalization is through Sor not a generalization. There's a hasty something, but not like a false attribution. I mean, you're kind of nibbling around the edges, so it gets a non secretor, right? It's all the vague things, but there's something really Super specific to exactly the logic that's being used in there. I'll give you a hint. There's actually a formal, logical fallacy in there. Formal? Yeah. Oh, boy. Here's the formal logical fallacy. So remember, in informal, logical fallacy may or may not be valid, depending on context like it's okay, sometimes to appeal to authority when the authority is appropriate, but not when it's overstating their authority. But if something is always wrong, always, always, always, not valid. That's usually a formal, logical fallacy. It has to be wrong by its fairy construction. So Here's the formal fallacy. It's affirming the consequent of affirming. The consequent sometimes called the converse error that say, if my lamp breaks, my room will be dark. Right? That's true. That's a valid statement. My room is dark. Therefore, my lamp must be broken. It's like, no, it ignores the fact that there could be other reasons why your room is dark other than your lamp being broken like somebody may have flipped the light off or the bulb is dead, but not the lamp or somebody borrowed the ball. But whatever. There's like all kinds of things that can happen. So here it's like as you can say, if you don't like humming birds, you will vote against this candidate. You voted against this candidate. You must not like humming birds. It's the same thing. No, it doesn't work both ways because there's lots of other reasons that your lamp could be offer. There's lots of other reaons that somebody might have voted against your candidate. It could be a matter of priority. It could be it that they just don't care about arming birds. They could think that they might like quails and want that to be the stat bird. Whatever. There's lots of other things go on. You can't assume the consequent from that. It's also the fallacy of the single cause in a way that it's assuming a single cause or reducing a complex issue or a complex case to one thing. And that holds with elections, there may be tons of policy and personality and other reasons why somebody might be for or against a candidate. And assuming it's one issue, the one issue you care about is the fallacy of the single cause. So that's happening as well is also, of course, once you attribute to other people, it becomes a straw man, right? You're using these other fallacies to create a straw man of their position by assuming you must hate coming birds. So that's in there as well. Makes sense. Yes. And it does happen. No, totally. So what you're saying is you don't like Hummingbird, right? Alright, guys, Let's go on with science or fiction. It's time for science all fiction. Each week I come up with three science items or Fax too real and one fake. And I challenge my panel skeptics coming with one needs to fake no fee this week. Just three news items. You guys ready? Ready? Yeah. All right. Item number one, an analysis of indoor air finds that commercial jet passenger cabins have the worst quality with the highest recorded levels of particulates. All right, number two, a new economic study finds that the externalized costs of the energy and transportation sectors equals almost 25,000,000,000,000 dollars per year or more than 28% the global gross domestic product. And number three, scientists report the first ever observation of a space Hurricane Hurricane in Earth's upper atmosphere. Bob, go first. All right, so Let's go with the first one here. Commercial jet, air quality. I mean, Yeah, I can kind of see that. I mean, aren't they just pulling air from outside the cabin? I mean, if you're flying in any sort of polluted area, I mean, they've got. They've got filters and stuff, but worst quality. I mean, I don't know, Let's look at the next one here the externalized costs of energy and transportation sectors. Yeah, 25,000,000,000,000. Sounds like a lot, but, I mean, I've heard other estimates over the years of what things really cost. Like oil, like the cost of oil. If you factor in the deaths of people because of our fossil fuels and the cost of, say, escorting an oil tanker on its trip and you just put all that together. It makes it far less competitive than and then again against solar or other ones. It's just so much more money when you look at the whole picture of the whole general sort of mishmash if you will. So I can kind of buy that one here. Although this could go in so many different directions. I don't know, Let's see. Scientist report first space Hurricane in the upper atmosphere. Sure it's upper Earth's atmosphere. There's not much actual atmosphere going on but there's plasma. There's magnetic field. Anything that has a some sort of a cyclonic action. You would say it's a Hurricane in space. So that's possible. So Yes, that one seems reasonable. Alright, I'm going to say that the jet the air quality and Jets is the worst is fiction. I guess the other two seem reasonable. Okay Jay. All right. So that's funny. You say that Bob. Because I was thinking that one with science. And I'll tell you why. I know that airplanes have HEPA filters. I know that they're pulling air from outside and then I'm thinking like you know how high up does pollution get? Is the air more polluted down near ocean level or hundreds of feet? Or is it? Is it how polluted is it at 20 30 40. 0 feet and I tend to think it would be less polluted up there because the particles are heavier unless the plane itself is giving off something that is bad like the plastics and the plane or something like that. But I'm so far I'm thinking that science. Yeah, I'm thinking that space Hurricanes, it sounds like a big dramatic thing where it's basically a Hurricane that happens in the upper atmosphere calling it a Hurricane because it's not like what we really think of as a Hurricane that we understand but sure there's weather that happens up there. And if they want to classify something as a Hurricane in the upper upper upper atmosphere, you know, I don't see why that's a problem. I just don't like them using the same word. So that's why I'm gonna say that. I think number two, the 1 about the energy and transportation sectors is the fiction, not because I have any profound insight. Just because I think the other two are science and Evan. So I'll go in reverse order. The observation of the space Hurricane. I think that one is science. I think Hurricane is defined as the formation but the wind speed involved probably defines it. Why? They haven't observed it before. I think is probably maybe the most interesting part of that. You think we have detected that before but first ever. That's cool. So I'm not surprised. I think that one science. I think the economic study one is science as well. These are extreme numbers we're talking about you're talking about 25,000,000,000,000 per year 28% of the global gross domestic product. But as Bob said, we are talking about energy. We're talking about transportation. These sectors are just, you know, enormous bigger than we probably even realize as lay people when it comes to this stuff. So I think that one's right, which means the commercial jet passenger cabins. Worst air quality. You would think that. Yes, that has some obvious reasons why that would be. But you have to think about what other indoor environments could be worse. I mean, you could have basements. You could have another subterranean areas which may have much greater problems with air and air flow and exchanging of the air. When you're in an airplane, you have access to the entire outside. So I have a feeling that that's the trick one there's ports the fiction. All right, so you all agree on the third one. So we'll start there. Scientists report the first ever observation of a space Hurricane Hurricane in Earth's upper atmosphere. You all think this one is science and this one is science? Yeah, this is cool. Yeah, I haven't. Why first ever. Yeah, that's the first ever is a surprising part. Not their space Hurricane, though. The name is cool. So Bob's, right? Yeah, it's mostly plasma and magnetic field stuff up there, but they have a lot of energy and they could get into patterns like a tropical storm or a Hurricane. But I guess they're just so wispy is why it was hard to observe them. But, Steve, what is it? Actually that's classifying it as a Hurricane? Is it the size, the size and the pattern and the speed and the energy? All those features, all those things? Yeah, and they said, this is important because for exoplanet studies because a lot of exoplanets probably have similar conditions and may also have upper atmosphere, space, Hurricanes. Yeah, but probably pretty hard to detect them if we just found the planet from here till we get on that solar lens right now. Yeah. All right, Let's go back to number one and analysis of indoor air finds that commercial jet passenger cabins have the worst quality with the highest recorded levels of particulates. Bob and Evan. You think this one is a fiction? Jay, you think this one is science and this one is say it the fiction. Yeah, I'm just not doing it this year. Yeah, this is okay. I was going to say, interesting my loss because you could kind of go both ways. If a lot of people crammed in there, it kind of smells weird in those planes. And you could easily think that there's got to be something going on there. But actually, what they found was that the commercial jet cabins had the lowest level of particulates. They actually the cleanest air. And Jay metyou mentioned all the reasons why. That's the case. They're high up. They're pulling an air from the outside. They got lots of filters. The airline industry has highly motivated to keep stuff out of the air because that's weight, it may not seem like much. But every pound affects their consumption. So that's why they were pretty happy to remember. What was it? The 90? S and the culture shifted and we started banning smoking on planes. That was so amazing. I had a little ashtrays in the arm rest. Oh, my God, man, you're in a non smoking row. But the row in front of you is smoking just ridiculous. Yeah, you rid of two. But just a particular matter from cigarette smoke would weigh a lot. It was a lot of weight and actually affected the amount of fuel that's planes as they were happy to ditch the sicker at smoking. Yeah. So the air is very clean. But what it is is extremely dry. It is dry literally is dries the Sahara desert. Because the higher you go, the lower the humidity in the air. And so they don't humidify the air. They like it dry too, because they don't want moisture getting into the seats and everything again adding weight. So the dry wish them. That's why you have to hydrate hydrate when you're on a plane. And the longer the flight, the higher they go, the drier, the air on international flights. It is bad. You really, really have to put on chapstick or lipstick. You have to bring your fluid with you and keep well, well hydrated. That means that a new economic study finds that the externalized costs of the energy and transportation sectors equals almost 25,000,000,000,000 dollars per year or more than 28% of the global gross domestic product. That is science. This is amazing. Of course, this is one study. There's a lot of estimation going on. But I suspect they're probably not off by in order magnitude right. And what they mean by externalized costs, it just means a cost born by someone other than the people involved. Right? The person who is selling the product, the person who's buying the product, it's externalized onto somebody who involuntarily done to somebody else. So in this case, if your health is adversely affected by the pollution of somebody else burning fossil fuel, that's an externalized cost. So it's a lot of health care costs. A lot of lost lives, lost product productivity. And one of you guys mentioned there's a lot of incidental costs. And all of that adds up. So we knew that we knew that. That there was a lot of externalized costs. We talk about a lot, but just the magnitude of it more than a quarter of gross domestic product. Think about that. That's like massive subsidy. We are subsidizing absolute energy and transportation to the tune of 25,000,000,000,000 dollars a year globally. In addition to their direct subsidies Here's, money allowing them to externalize costs like that is a is a form of subsidy. The economists estimate that if the producers the people who are profiting off of this were accountable for all of the externalized costs that coal, for example, would cost twice as much as a Yes. Right. Which Wow. And then this is the thing where politically it's very interesting because I hear people say, Oh, if we did this, it would double the cost of gasoline as if it's a great thing or as if it's a horrible thing. Right? Depending on your perspective, if you're looking at it through the narrow lens of short term economic effects, then it could be like, Yeah, I'd horrible for the economy. It's like, well, it's already horrible for the economy. This is just a hidden cost versus a more overt cost. You still it's. The thing is, you don't think you're paying for it, but you are you're paying that extra whatever. 2 3 dollars a gallon just not at the pump you're paying for in higher health insurance in higher costs elsewhere in lost productivity and lost opportunities, you are paying for it and people who would be happy to have the prices increase. So first of all, it's fair because then you know the people who are profiting are the ones who are paying the cost and two it actually makes green energy more cost effective. Yes, how competitive cost effective would zero carbon energy be if we had to directly pay the externalized costs of fossil fuel? For example, suddenly suddenly knock it off the page. It's already good like solar and wind energy is already competitive. It would be massively, more competitive. And also there is a direct correlation between for example, the efficiency of the cars people buy and the cost of gasoline. When gas prices go up, people buy more fuel efficient cars. When gas prices are low, people buy huge cars because they don't care. And so allowing the price of gasoline to go up and cover some of that externalized costs would in fact be a huge incentive to burn less gasoline to have more fuel efficient cars. Right? Plus is a whole global warming thing. Yeah, right. On top of on top of all this top of it, this would be true without global warming. Global warming is just makes it 10 times worse. One of the most effective things we can do to combat global warming might be to account for these externalized costs that's it isn't that that's where the carbon taxes are in tax carbon tax that the carbon tax is all about. All right. Well, good job, Robin. Evan. That was a little tricky. Wow. Yeah. You know a good effort. Win some, you lose some. That's good effort to some of those get a consolation prize. Thank you. Remember the constellation price you get a constellation. Alright Evan, give us a quote. Nothing in science has any value to society if it is not communicated and scientists are beginning to learn their social obligations and that was written by Anne Roe R-O-E her book the making of a scientist in 1 953 pretty amazing sort of foretelling the future a bit. And obviously there was a disturbing lack of that occurring in the middle of the 20 th century. The fact that science was these black box operations in which people had no idea what kind of really the general population had no idea how the heck go. A lot of these things worked or what was going on and it's become so important. We take it for granted nowadays. 2,021. I mean, we see science everywhere. It's being communicated thoroughly in a lot of places. But back then, it was sorely lacking and she called for the need to pay attention to this that scientists have to discuss with the public exactly what is going on. It's too important for society to not know what value science have and how it's making things improve in people's lives. I have a slightly different perspective. I mean, I agree with what you just said, but she's talking specifically about scientists. I think icon has come a long way. And there's a lot of good science communication going on. But I think 70 years later she would be disappointed in the culture of scientists communicating to the public. I think we haven't come nearly as far and it's amazing to read about this 70 years ago. They finally, scientists are starting to catch on. Really, a lot of them still haven't even seen a lot of them. Still haven't. But there's been this whole branch of science, communication, a specialty almost on to itself and largely so a lot of it. Independent of actual scientists and academics. Sure. But some of it has come from people who are scientists. There are examples. It's a hybrid, right? Yeah, it's definitely better, but it's just not nearly where it should be, in my opinion. And we've talked about this argument before because the others, maybe side of that coin is that, well, if the scientists were more concentrating on the communication of what they were doing, they wouldn't be in the lab doing the science work that they had to do, there may be some validity to that. Well, I mean, it's partly a zero of some game, but it doesn't take that much effort to build in a little bit more SICOM. The other thing is, for those who want to do it, you know, give it academic credit and let them. Those who had the inclination, the town, the ability to do it, to just give it the value that it needs. Absolutely. Again. Look at our society. Look at what we're going through. You don't think that we need to do better in science? Communication? We absolutely do. Always. We will always have to do better. I don't know that that will ever end. Yeah. All right. Thank you guys for joining me this week. Sure, man. Thanks, Steve. Thank you, Steve, we miss you. Kara, Yeah, we will probably do the live stream yesterday. You know, that sounds weird. We're still doing the Friday live stream. It's going to happen most Fridays, but we can't guarantee it because it's not locked into our schedule and if we're going to miss a week we will give you a notice we'll put a message in various locations including on our website to let you know we've done it most like in the last year we've done almost every week it's only is hardly missed a week. Yeah, absolutely. So it's rare rare alright, guys, we'll see you on Friday and until next week this is your skeptics guide to the universe skeptics guide to the universe is produced by SGU productions dedicated to promoting science and critical thinking for more information visit us at the skeptics guide org send your questions to info at the skeptics guide org and if you would like to support the show and all the work that we do go to Patreon com skeptics guide and consider becoming a patron and becoming part of the SGU community our listeners and supporters are what make Su possible.
