You're listening to the skeptics guide to the universe, your escape to reality. Hello, and welcome to the skeptics guide to the universe. Today is Tuesday, February, 23, Rd 2,021 and this is your host, Stephen novella. Joining me this week, or Bob novella, Hey, everybody. Cara, Santa Maria Addy, Jane novella, Hey, guys. And Evan Bernstein. Good evening, everyone. So it's finally warming up in Texas. We touched a little bit on the energy was the electricity was that we're having there last week's show. But now we've had a full week for the whole story to unfold Steve before we get into the details because we say, listen, everyone in Texas, it was really a hard thing to watch. We had our friend on that lived there. It was scary. It was horrible for so many people and anything that we say is not judging the people that went through that. We're going to chit chat today about, you know, what went wrong in Texas, but we're in no way pointing fingers at citizens who suffered in all this. Oh, they're the victims, for sure. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So Here's the interesting bit of misinformation that's going around. So immediately people start pushing their political agenda, right? Because that's what people do. That's what they do. Yeah. So the Republicans were blaming the wind turbines. They said that they were freezing up there, and that's why there was the rolling blackouts and there was basically the electrical grid was failing. That's not sense. The quick story is there's three electrical grids in the United state in the lower 48. I should say, there's the Eastern. The Western grid in Texas. Texas is its own grid. It did that specifically to avoid regulations on selling electricity across state lines, comparing tanglements well. And by the way, not all of Texas El Paso happens to be slivered into the Western grid and just is that right? Yeah. So compare how El Paso did. They didn't lose power. Oh, Yeah. You can't come really compare it. If you get into a problem, you could buy electricity from another neighboring state. That's kind of the bigger the grid, the better and the more renewables we have in the system, we want the grids to be even bigger. Like we may need to connect the Eastern and Western grids if we really want to maximize renewable because over capacity is one of the ways that you deal with the intimate nature of it. But in any case, Texas is its own grid, and they also have a very, very deregulated system. So what that meant practically was that the energy companies were not required to winterize their facilities, so they didn't even though they had some a culture snap 10 years ago with 2,011 and hearing saying we need to ensure that this never happens again. You guys need to winterize your equipment, and they were like, no, and they didn't. It was voluntary, so they chose not to spend money to do it. And they did that to keep their prices down. Partly inevitably, we got it happened again. So it wasn't just the wind turbines. Every single energy source failed coal, natural gas, nuclear, and the user. All of it they want. I mean, I saw some perpetual motion machines were stopping. I saw some officials from the actual energy company saying we were literally days, maybe even hours away from a blackout that could have lasted months. My car, they say, said, minutes, maybe seconds is what they actually said. Minutes. Wait, what does that mean? What was happening? Kara, what was the situation that would have made it a lot worse. They were close. So this is the problem. When part of the electrical grid goes down? Because because it fails, then other parts have to kick in to take over. Then they overload. So they shut down to keep from overloading. And it's this cascading shutdown cascade across the grid. That's what happened, because I do National rolling Brown outs on purpose to try and relieve the pressure off the grid. Plus, it wasn't so much rolling. They did it right before the grid failed in a way that would have caused damage that would have taken a long time to ride. So they just barely avoided that. But they did that with rolling blackouts. And then there were actual blackouts when again, you have that cascading failure. Yeah, but the other angle there, Steve. Some of those rolling blackouts weren't rolling at all because it's like the wealthy communities had it all the time. And the not so wealthy communities didn't. So it was kind of a document that. Yeah. So what happened? What I read, we. They spared critical infrastructure like hospitals. Where do you think the hospitals are located right in neighborhoods that had it's totally reasonable to not cut power to a hospital, but they couldn't just pick out the hospital. They had to spare of the entire neighborhood. And so that difference, like the wealthy versus the poor neighborhoods, had to do with that's where the hospitals were. But that was the end. The result was, Yes, some of the more wealthy neighborhoods were spared the rolling blackouts. But there were actually permanent blackouts in some locations caused for days by just the overload, because the thing is, no matter. I remember with coal, natural gas and nuclear, they all ultimately do the same thing. They make steam and they turn a turbine. And it was that those components, they're moving the water around that froze because they didn't have heaters on them. And the other thing is, we have wind turbines in new England. They don't freeze here because we have heaters on them. They're just winter. Winterized? Yeah, nothing. So the problem was that all of the energy production modalities were not winterized to pick out wind turbines and say, they failed. And they were. The problem is pure nonsense. That is just political propaganda. The first problem was that their grid, which they is unregulated and is privately owned was not winterized. The second problem. And with that, all the other problems we talked about not being able to borrow energy from other parts of the country not being able to distribute the need. So the second problem is that on this unregulated market in Texas are allowed to sell wholesale energy, they're allowed to sell variable rate, wholesale energy. And Unfortunately, that also disproportionately affects poorer people because the rates are significantly lower, they come with a greater risk, but they're more affordable in the day to day. And since Texas by and large doesn't deal with this, except it just did 10 years ago. Basically, most every day, people think I'm going to look at these rates. They are significantly lower if I take a variable rate because you usually we're not in the hot box or the cold box as it were. Yeah, Unfortunately, there was no mechanism in place. So when one particular, I read a deep dive about one particular variable rate company called gritty, who buys wholesale and sells off directly to the customer. They actually saw what was happening. Basically, the bubble bursting right in front of them, and they frantically reached out to their customers saying, you need to dump us. Now, if you don't dump us now and get with a flat rate energy company within the next day or two, you're going to be hit with bills that are thousands of dollars. 40. Dollars. I really did that. That was actually nice of them to. Well, we do that because ultimately they're unregulated. They're doing what the market allows them to do as a business. Whether you want to say that's an ethical practice or not is a point, but it's Besides this point. Ultimately, when they saw that this had a terrible backlash effect for themselves and for their customers, they were like, we don't have any safeties in place. The only way to avoid getting hit with a 15,000 dollars electric bill is to dump out now. But what are you going to do? They're going to be able to call and wait on hold with the electric company in the middle of this blackout, like so many people didn't worth a shot. Yeah, exactly. It was worth the shot or they didn't read that email for two days. Exactly. They didn't either have electricity or they were too busy trying to board up their windows. Yeah, I mean, some people have to swap, though the wholesale market as predatory. And that seems to be reasonable because they acted the same way that variable rate mortgages were predatory. It's upfront. It sounds great. You get this low rate. But the thing is, by getting the cheap upfront wholesale electricity, you're basically not paying for insurance, right? It's like a guarantee it's really cheap to drive without insurance because you get into an accident, and then the other person gets screwed. Not just you. So in this case, the federal government's having to bail out Texas Yeah because it themselves didn't regulate and this is the part that pisses me off because who keeps winning in these schemes the people who keep getting money regardless of what they do to protect the consumers and that's why this story makes me angry because what we're talking about here is not a luxury item we're talking about a necessity to live electricity keeps people alive well that's what creates proportion incentives right if you do, the system exists so that people can take a risk to make a lot of money but if the risk bites them they ask somebody else pays for it. That's what we call the perverse incentive that's a set up for bad stuff to happen so that's what regulation exists Yeah but I don't mind free market solutions and having the free market that's great I think you need to balance that with regulations obviously but you can't build in perverse incentives where it's a win win the investors make all the money and they never lose because they get bailed out because of whatever they're critical or the 10,000 dollar bills to their customers and the customers need to get well and that's a classic example of the freest of free markets that's the problem when you really look at laws a fair economics what you're saying is anytime there's a demand we're going to because supply is low and the demand increases the costs are going to shift and that's when that guy Cavelle whatever that scumbag was raised the price to thousands of dollars for that Metascore Yeah but that's a slightly different example because in this case the algorithm was set in advance and we knew this was going to happen we knew this before and they weren't fixing they were doing the opposite they were saying no matter what we're never going to cap and so ultimately without a cap the free market was doing exactly what it was designed to do which is to basically enable or enact these perverse incentives and put all the burden on the consumer so that the people at the very, very top made their money anyway and then when there was still a problem a regulatory problem what ends up happening the federal government so our federal taxes end up paying off the place where the state taxes aren't being collected and that's frustrating Yeah that really sucks and the bottom line is it was the lack of winter rising because nobody wanted to spend the money to invest in it. That was the ultimate problem the thing is it's so fixable and invention is so much it's so much living on the real need to be living in the render the public pressure now will be on to do this and they'll finally get their access why? Why would the pressure be on us now? Because next time it happens then everyone else's taxes will pay for this that's appear to bail them out again right? Well I think it's because people died. You know, there's a certain point where money doesn't even matter anymore when people's lives are on the line and that's I think the jury's out whether we cross that line in terms of. Yeah, we'll see people do. I mean, you know, you know how people are on the weather's in the seventies. You know, people are going to forget about this and move to the next thing. And then in 10 years or five years or next month, it's going to happen again. Gosh, I hope not. Well, that's the other question is nobody knows. The answer to this is what's the real relationship between events like this. Like this ridiculously cold weather in Texas and global warming is extreme weather events like this. Are they going to be coming more frequently? Yeah, it seems that way. So I don't know that we have enough evidence yet to say for sure, but it certainly is possible that we might be seeing more extreme events like this. We certainly can no longer be confident that past experience is going to predict future experience. That's what can. But that's what the signs predicts more extreme weather events. That's true. But it you're, right. Pointing to a specific example. My hope is just that individuals within their communities organize that people who had to put up with this and who were damaged, some of whom irreparably some of whom lost limb or life. See this as something that's beyond the pale. Because the only way that change is going to be affected is if pressure is put on by the constituents. It's the only way you're going to change. Yeah, totally. Okay, Let's move on. Kara, you're going to do a what's the word this week? I am so this word was recommended or suggested by Michael via. Hopefully I'm pronouncing that right from St. Louis, he said, I work in electromagnetic compatibility and came across this word when researching lightning formation. The word is percolation. This is the fun one for the whole team, specifically because it can be tied to fractals and coffee. It's all of our buttons percolation theory or my professions. Application of it at least is a statistical way of modeling current paths through composites made up of various materials with different properties. And I was like, what is that? So I started to research a little bit more. And what I love. Oh, the title of his email was, what's the word? I've got a fun one because I say that every I got a fun one. Okay, so percolation when we think of the word percolation, maybe we should do that this backward and look at the etymology first sensations. Yeah, actually, you said, look at it back. Oh, gosh too dense. I thought you were going to really. Do you notice that I probably laugh more Evan when it's somebody else's story and you do one of your funny Evan jokes because I'm not invested in. What am I going to say next, what is the depth of this? I don't want to screw this up. That's right. Yeah, that's finalize. I'm throwing you off your right as the warm edits the show, I could tell you that Kara and Evan giggle at every joke. And Bob and Jay do not. I want to have jokes and everything funny in the show. For the record, Jay and I laugh at the good ones. Yes, we have the selection, Evan. And I just funny, but just, you know, humor is an important part of our life, that's all. Yeah. I mean, it's good to wear rose colored glasses because you're just happier. Her life is pain, man. You see the absurdity and the suffering. Welcome to my existential world. J. All right, circulation, the pie of the first root of the proto Indo European root per means forward. And in this case, they're kind of taking that as through and then collate. This is an interesting suffix in that we don't really know where it came from. But we do know that the whole word together percolation came from the Latin, and so the collate part translates to strain. So it comes from Colum, which is a strainer or like a SIV. So to percolate is to strain through, to Sive through. And that's really what the word means, right? That's the usage that we're all used to. If something percolates through something, it's moving through a permeable substance. Sometimes it's to extract the solute out of it. Sometimes it's to take just the liquid component out of it. So with coffee, we're percolating through. But we're just keeping the water that has had the coffee grounds. Percolated. We're not keeping the grinds. We're throwing those away. In other cases, we're percolating something in order to pull out the solute. Does that make sense? Like confusion? Yeah. Remember when we were building my House in Oxford and the surveyor went out there and did the perk test? Right? The absorb how fast the lamb would absorb water. Yeah. And so you will see that you'll see, the word used more specifically in engineering, surveying geology. You'll see percolation through rock through soil. You also will see it in a more literary sense. Right? Like, this idea is percolating right now. Just letting it kind of similar, letting it sort of move through my brain juices. And eventually it's going to settle. So that's kind of the typical term that we use. But of course, my interest was peak by Michael when he talked about percolation theory, so I started to do some deep dives. It's complicated, very complicated. And it does have to do with fractal geometry. It also has to do with statistical physics and math. We see material science. We even see it in network series. So the best way that I found for somebody to describe percolation was talking about, Let's say, a piece of foam, for example, or really any somewhat poor structure. Let's say a big chunk of terracotta. If I was to pour water on top of a piece of terracotta, how would I calculate where the water would end up as it's seeping through? What would its path be? Because there all these little. Yeah, there are all these little random holes so we don't have perfect nodes. We don't have perfect links. What we have is this porous substrate that's random? So this is a theory that uses these different structures to try and describe phenomena passing through in this random graph. And it's fascinating as you start to dig deep and you start to see all of these little schematics of percolation theory, you can see representations of percolation theory using these really complicated and beautiful graphs. And so in a way, not even in a way pretty directly. It relates back to that route beautifully. But if you didn't know what percolation theory is, it not your head might not go to that place. So I guess Michael's profession, which he didn't say what it is. They use percolation theory to model current paths through composites made up of various materials with different properties. So he may be in more of a material science or engineering example of that. But you also see the modeling used kind of more. Theoretically, you might see used in fractal geometry. You might see it used more in other versions of mathematics where there is no actual substrate. But instead, we're modeling what would happen with a random substrate, and it fascinating. So thank you for the opportunity, Michael, for me to dig into percolation theory and to percolate a little bit on this fun word. Yeah, when you think you know what a word means, but it really has so many more meetings. Very cool. Yeah. And in this case, it's really fun because it's one of those words where the root stays there. You know how sometimes we're like, okay, this word is used here, here, here. And I still can't figure out why this is the word that this field how to describe this phenomenon. But in this case, it all comes right back to that beautiful route of basically putting something through a site of something moving through pores. The etymology is highly conserved. It is. I am saying that car. Do you ever think of all the animals that can fly? The fly got the name. Why would they? Why would they give the most insignificant thing that flies that and the net? But there should be a giant bird called the fly? You know what I mean? No, I like that. It's such a little one. I like that because then everything else would be the fuzzy fly or the beat fly. See, why didn't we do that? That's the question. Why aren't there more kinds of fly? I mean, there are a lot of flies. There are a lot different, but they're all flies. They're not a lot of different things that fly what they call a flying squirrel. A glide? Yeah, it's not flying. There are sugar gliders. I think they're very glider. Yeah, they're little squirrel. No sugar gliders aren't bats. No, you're right. I'm sorry. They're little guys. They're like squirrels. What are they called that flappin inapplicable snakes. Danger noodles. I love the rash pants at the I love the whistle. Pigs. Yeah. All right, Jay, tell us all about the perseverance. Yeah, not the perseverance, which so many people that I nascence is completely kicked ass. It had for a very long time. But this mission has really impressed the hell out of me with everything. Once you start reading about what was achieved here. So the Mars Rover mission that we just saw the it's called the Mars 2,020. And this Rover mission by NASA's Mars exploration program is a mission that was originally announced back in 2,012. And it includes or included three major components. So there's the cruise stage that was used to travel between Earth and Mars. There's the entry, descent, and landing lending system Els that includes the arrow shell, descent, vehicle, and heat shield. And then we have the Sky crane that was needed to deliver perseverance and ingenuity safely to the surface. And just so you know, the ingenuity is the test helicopter. I'll give you a little bit of information about in a minute. So Mars 2,020 mission, this was launched on an Atlas five launch vehicle. It took six months to reach Mars, and it landed just a few days ago. February 18. Th 2,021. So the perseverance Rover has a slate of missions, primary objectives, all list off to you. This is exactly what NASA had on their website is to explore a geologically diverse landing site, assess ancient habitability, and they do this. And this is me talking by investigating its surface, the geological processes in the geological history. And when they're saying assess ancient habitat ability, they're talking about did things live there previously? And what was the previous habitat seek signs of ancient life. They're looking for these things and rocks in different places that they would expect there to be signs of life. That's where the Rover is going to be looking. Gather rock and soil samples. This is amazing. So this is the Rover is going to be gathering soil samples, samples, putting them into a test tube, and leaving them on the surface of Mars for a later pickup mission, which I'll tell you about and demonstrate technology for future robotic and human exploration. So let me get into some details here. The Rover is gathering samples on the Mars regular, right? Does that sound sexy? It's cool. But let me tell you, this, sexy, the samples are going to be stored in tubes, and then it's literally going to leave them on the ground as it rolls through its path. So it's going to leave a path of tubes behind it. Perseverance, can't I pick up the samples once it puts them down? And eventually, though, the goal is to return these samples back to Earth and this mission. And I have to do a side step here and just quickly tell you about this mission. It's scheduled in 2,026. And the preparation of the samples is a key part of the perseverance mission because in 2,026 for sending something called the sample retrieval lander. And like I said, it's slated to leave Earth in 2,026, and they'll be picking up the samples on the sample fetch row. It's going to be like a little dog that runs around the they know exactly where the samples are with satellite information and they're measuring distances between objects, and they're calculating exactly where they are. The Rover is going to go pick them up. It's going to be designed and built by the European space agency. And then that Rover is going to deliver them to another thing that's going to shoot it like a soccer ball. With all the samples stuck into it, it's going to shoot up out to another thing that's going to send it back to Earth. So that mission is really cool. I'm dying to read all the details about that. Wait, how is it actually lifting off of Mars to send it back to Earth? That soccer ball payload gets put on a little spaceship that launches it back into orbit. And then another thing takes it home that. Well, that sounds like that will be the very first thing launched off of Mars, then, right? Have we ever is going to be the first thing? It's going to be the first thing that is bringing back samples from Mars is something that's the land and then take off again. That's right. You're right, Bob. That's a big deal. So Let's keep going. Perseverance is also responsible for scoping out the landing site for the next phase of the sample return mission, which they're using it to find a really flat area. But they also keep in mind they want that sample return mission to be near where the Rover is to pick up all the do dad. So it's going to land right in that vicinity. Again, NASA designed the Rover with its pastor over curiosity in mind, which was very smart because many of the components developed for curiosity were used in perseverance. So it was a very low cost way of reusing technology that has already been proven. And they added only the things that needed to be added to help this mission achieve its goals. Like as an example, they added the core all that takes samples and some new instrumentation. The Rover has 19 video cameras and two microphones, which means they're ready to make rock and roll videos, which I think is the Rover is also going to test technology in the Martian dust to see how it possibly could interfere with technology. Right? They want to know, is this dust going to get into stuff and do nasty things because we know that the moon has a really nasty, sharp edged regolith. So they want to know, what is this Martian terrain going to do and what's the dust like? Is it dangerous? Perseverance will also test technology. And I think this is the one that really blew my mind the most. It'll take Martian carbon dioxide and do what, guys, what do you think they're going to do with it? Smoke it on carbon dioxide, make oxygen out of it, right? They're making pure oxygen out of it. And what is pure oxygen. Good for it's. Good eating. And for Rockets. Exactly. Oxygen is one of those things. You could use it in so many different ways. But the two main things is it's for rocket fuel and for people to breathe. So compassion. That's awesome. So I guess in the future, they're going to put instrumentation out there and machinery that could slowly process oxygen, which is great. Just pull it out of the co two that's in the atmosphere, the Rover is also going to try to find subsurface water or at least prove that it's there. Improve future landing techniques and study the weather. And in particular, they want to know what's in the air. They want to know what particulate makes up the air again. This information is vital to send actually people there and other robots. So this will help them determine how they need to build habitats. It'll determine and how they will need to build future technology, other robots and things like that. Another interesting upgrade in the mission is a guidance and control system called the terrain relative navigation. So if you watched perseverance get deployed by the Sky crane, you may have noticed that it made some lateral movements to find better and to find a better landing site. So the new system allowed the Sky crane to change its heading during the last moments of the landing process and past missions didn't have this. And what happened in one of the past missions. They landed in a bad place that was suboptimal. And that's bad because you have all of this money. All these people, all this human effort, and you land in a crater and you're kind of screwed with that water. Would water be suboptimal? Absolutely. But they're not gonna build up aquatic. Yeah, they're building Rovers, not boats. Of course they don't want to land in mushy area. There is no thinking there is a water. Water was on the water. No water would be optimal for a sub, so it would be suboptimal. Oh, Yeah. I will move on. Yeah, I liked it. That's a thinker. Yeah, just. Just out extra funny when they're expected to know anyone. Bob the little helicopter. Please let me talk about this guy. He deserves a little love. So he's a little robotic helicopter ingenuity and he will test or she will test powered flight. And Mars's extremely thin atmosphere. It's a big deal, guys. The helicopter or she like a drone. Well, they're calling it a robotic helicopter. That's a job. Because I don't want to talk about stuff. I'm not an expert. Like, what's the difference between a helicopter and a drone? I think. Well, helicopters piloted usually. I think it has to do with the self flying helicopters. Alright, so this little guy is going to be used to be first. It's going to be the first thing that has ever flown on an alien planet that we know. And it has five planned flights. Each of them is going to last about 90 seconds. It'll go up about three to 5 meters in those things. Three to 5 meters. As it goes up, it's going to be flying around, of course. And man, I'm hoping that it has a couple of cameras on it. It's got to have a camera at that would bump me out if they didn't stick a GoPro on there. Yeah, but at least perseverance will be shooting it. We'll see what it does. But it's going to take off. It's going to fly around. It's going to do some maneuvering. It's going to land. And when are they going to find out how much energy did it take? I actually did the atmosphere interfere or play nice with the way they designed the blades, blah, blah, blah, BL blah. They're going to do all these things that are going to tell us awesome information. So when we want to put like a real flying machine down on that planet will know how to build it. Now, one last thing, I thought this was really, really cool. If you look at the parachute that was used to slow down the Sky crane and Rover on the set, it had a secret message encoding the parachute had a series of red and white stripes that were put in a pattern that was some internet users. Air quotes, internet users discovered the hidden message it was written in binary language, which is a computer language. And once they decoded it, it said, no, send more Chuck Berry. Of course. Anybody that watched SNL back in the 70 s knows that one. No, it said dare mighty things. And this happens to be a key phrase at NASA's. Jake, that's awesome. Somebody sat around and said, Hey, I know you guys are working on the Super important stuff, but Let's not forget that we got to send some humanity to Mars. Let's send a message along with the parachute that's sitting on the surface of Mars now and probably will be there for a very long time. It says dare mighty things. I love that. Didn't they do something similar with curiosity where the wheels in Morse code said, JPL, I think you're right. Yeah, it's like they couldn't be so overt by actually writing that. But they coded it, which makes it extra fun. They totally shouldn't put like human footprint marks on the wheels as it rolls around. It a great thing. Yeah, that's what we need now, guys. Of course please do more reading. There's so much I left out there's so much more detail to this and read about that retrieval mission as well because this is a really cool thing that they're doing it's in the works. It's not like something that they're cooking up. It's in the works. We're gonna do it and that at some point in the next six to 8 years, I don't know how long it's gonna take you. Maybe it all happened in 2,026. The whole mission might be resolved. We might have Martian regolith on Earth that we could study and do all the analysis that we need to to find out what it's made of is the microbes in it. Think of these samples that are being collected are important samples because the team at JPL is going to tell the Rover when to take a sample. This is the 46 th mission to land something on Mars. Guess how many of them were complete failures out of 46? They've only landed like eight things at six could be a lot like in the 20 s. I think it's in the 30 s there's so many failed mission failures. There were 22 complete failures, two partial failures. Okay, so as I thought so, more than half. So this utter success you got to think about this is pre. We have incredible amount of data of what parts were out and when on the previous Rovers and again, I'll remind you, the other Rovers lasted way longer than they even intended. Remarkably longer. Like people were doing things with these Rovers they never intended to do with them. So now we have a Rover on there that landed without a hiccup. They have it reinforced all the things that wore out on the other Rovers. This thing's going to last a long time. They have a one year plan for it and then they go, Yeah. And if it lasts longer than a year, you know what's going to last longer than a year. This thing is going to be kicking out away for a long time. Yeah. Cool. All right. Thanks, Jay. Bob, let me ask you a question. Do you think it's possible to communicate with somebody while they're dreaming? I know it is absolutely. Wake up. You're dreaming. Hey. Without waking them awesome. Without waking, does it have to be verbal? Yes. Your communication to them is verbal owned. So not like putting their hand in warm water. So I don't know if that counts as communication. So this is an interesting question that researchers set out to answer. It tells us a lot about what the dreaming state actually is. Obviously dreaming is something we all experience even if you don't remember your dreams you dream everybody dreams the dream state as you know is rapid eye movement or REM REM sleep we call it that because when your dream dreaming your brainstem basically paralyzes everything below the next so you don't Act out your dreams, right? But you can still move your eyes. You can still move your face a little bit. So your eyes are undergoing rapid movement while you're dreaming. Because that's one of the body parts that's not paralyzed unless you have certain parasomnias. And then you do Act out your dreams. Yeah. People can quote unquote sleepwalk, or they could. They could. That's a Paris that's parasomnia. It's nothing wrong with the wiring for sleep. But it's not walking happening during REM. I thought it was non REM. No, it's usually nonREM. Yeah, that's interesting. So I see that you dream during other parts of sleep. Just not as much really so non REM. Yeah. There are some dreaming happens in other stages of sleep. Even non REM stages of sleep. So what is happening in your brain when you're dreaming? If you look at an EEG pretty, you think you could tell the difference been somebody's dreaming and awake? It's not easy. It's subtle. It's largely the same. Yeah, it's almost the same. It's pretty much a wake dreaming and awake. Your brain is really active when you're dreaming, which makes sense. If you look at an fMRI, which is a little bit more detail than Egmont of the brain is active. What about your motor cortex? The motor cortex is active, but it's just being paralyzed on the way down. Okay, it makes sense, that's all there. All the sensory areas are being active. The only part of the brain that's less active is the frontal lobe. It makes sense. Yeah. You're not doing a lot of checking and balancing on yourself when you're switching. There's not a lot of reality testing. Yeah, that's a lot of inhibition at the talking elephant. Who cares? Yeah, right. Probably because if you were, you'd wake up. You'd realize you were dreaming, and then we've spoken many times on the show about lucid dreaming, which is a REM dream state. When you have awareness of the fact that you're dreaming so pretty waked. This is a slightly different state than normal dreaming, obviously, because you have enough awareness to tell that you're dreaming. It's very unstable. You tend to either dream you wake up or actually wake up one of the those two things happens. Of course you dream, you wake up, you lose your lucidity, go back. You think you're awake. So now you don't know that you're dreaming. What the researchers did was they actually looked at people who can get into the lucid dreaming state. And there's things you could do to sort of trigger that and to train yourself to make it more likely. And then while subjects were lucid dreaming, they try to communicate with them. Previous researchers have done this, but what they've essentially relied upon the subject reporting what happened after they woke up, which is sort of has all the same problems as, like, near death experience. Yeah, but that's not true. But that's not true, because I know in the 80 s 1 981 let Steven Leber's relied on EEGs to detect eye movements as a method of communication. He used EMS to catalog things like you could fit clench in your dream. And you can create a detectable signal in an EMG. It's subtle because you're paralyzed. But it's detectable. And they've also communicated over breathing. If you hold your breath or breathe rapidly in a lucid dream that is detectable outside of a lucid dream. So this is one of the reasons why I'm very disappointed with this research on the verge of disgusted. Because this was 40 years ago, lebersh was doing this. The only difference that I could tell is that this is now. Oh, it's in real time. You don't have to look at an EEG and see what these people within a lucid dream were saying a few hours ago or an hour ago or 10 minutes ago. They're doing it in real time. Big whoop. Yeah, but that is exactly the incremental thing. Or a 40 year incremental leap. Wow. Good job, guys. I think it's a little bit more than what you're saying. It's bringing it. Then tell me that the person who's lucid dreaming is communicating out. I'm telling you that. I'm telling you that's what they were doing. They figured out a way to communicate. Hang on. It's what they demonstrated. You tell me if they did this 40 years ago. And maybe they did. I don't know, send message. Had. Well, it's not just sending messages out. They were able to respond to the information that was being given to them while they were lucid dreaming. That's from my understanding is that's the new bid? Yes. That's a new bit while you're asleep, make sure you clench your fist really hard. No, not in your time. It's a lucid dreaming. It's not just responding. They ask you a question. You have to understand the question. You have to formulate an answer and then communicate your answer back. Back to me. Yes. And that is an incremental in advance. But back 40. Years ago, they were agreeing. Okay. When you recognize your lucid, you do this pattern of psychos with your eye so that we could see it in your EEG got left, left, right. And then that will mean you started lucid dreaming. And then they had a lucid dream. They remembered what they plan to do and they did it. And then they read that back out in the EEG or the EMG. So, Yes, it's an improvement beef. Is that after 40 years, this is always. It took 40 years in. They could have done it 40 years ago. But this is different than this means, though, that while lucid dreaming, you can hear, understand and absorb something. Somebody is saying that's a new Bob. I'm not surprised at all. I'm not surprised at all. Did you guys both say earlier that lucid dreaming and the alert awake state are barely import. They're imperceptibly different on scan. Looking at. They're very, very similar. Mean, reverse person's actually asleep. We all dream some of us. Lucid dream. If you're a lucid dreamer, you know, when you're lucid dreaming. I mean, they're not going to be fooling themselves. That's for sure if they're charlatans and they're trying to trick the researchers. And. Yeah, that's possible. But that's so remote. I don't even think it's word. Sorry. The subjects in this study are known and self described. Lucid dreamers. They're not doing people who were in that's. If you're going to do research on lucid, dream on. Lucid dreaming. You better. You almost have to get as someone who has some facility with lucid dreaming. Otherwise, you'll be waiting a month. Or a lucid dream. To be clear, I know that's your area of interest, Bob. I wasn't sure that the study had anything to do with lucid dreaming. It sounded to me like the study was just. Can people hear and respond even when they're asleep? But it's on people who are in the lucid dreamer. That wasn't clear to me. You probably didn't make it. I said it okay, because that would be a massive problem with their study. You need to make sure we're actually asleep. Yeah, but also they're doing EGS on the people they're making sure they're in. They know what sleep stage they're in. This study was done by four different labs at the same time, using slightly different methods. And they didn't publish. This is what I like this. The basic internal control. It was replicated four times before. And they all published together. So just to make it more robust, because otherwise you could ask a lot of questions about. Was this a fluke? Was this somebody who was punking? The researchers or whatever? Yes, it was good science. Yes. Yeah. So scientifically like that internal control thing a little bit more was that robust. It does make you think about where. Theoretically, this could go. Maybe we'll wait another 40 years, Bob, and do another incremental thing. But for example, if we could figure out some way to talk, stabilize the lucid dreaming state, then could you? To be honest, what kind of experience could you have at that point? Could it be, like, inception, where you have this hyper real movie adventure? Kind of lucid dreaming thing that lasts for hours. That would be okay. Here's the thing. I don't want to work or play or whatever that is that you're talking about doing while I'm asleep, then sit on a Beach and drink and drink a cocktail. I want my brain to do what it needs to do while it's asleep. I don't want to tell some Hardy shows. Well, I don't think you're a separate question. Shorting yourself on anything by lucid dream. I don't think you know that yet, Bob. I don't think any of us know that yet. Yeah. The question is, would that interfere with memory consolidation? Right? And maybe not even just memory consolidation, but the other restorative cellular properties, like all the things that happen during sleep. If we're forced to active, that probably happens during the deeper stages of sleep. And this is. Yeah, you're probably right. This is the REM sleep when your brain. It Super active. Anyway, it's already only fact it is when you're awake, I still wonder if there's some sort of mechanism by which the way that our dreams play out as we know they do aid in memory consolidation. But we still don't know how. And I wonder if interrupting that mechanism by giving it more order wouldn't be detrimental in some way are will do that study in 80. Years. Yeah, exactly. We don't know yet. Which is why I might, in this specific case, use the precautionary principle. And I do know is too much as who are sleep deprived. Die hard. It death. Yeah. This has nothing to do with sleep deprivation. Because if you extend your Ram, you will actually increase your sleep hygiene. I think. I mean, that's what you need. Ram. Ram is what you need, but we don't know yet if that's also true. If you do it through induced dreams. Yeah. If you have extended lucid REM, though. Yeah. I don't know. That resort is that. I don't know. My guess is that it would be, but I think we would know if we actually did more research in the past 40 years. We probably know that by now, I do have to say, though, there's a part of me that is still highly not skeptical of the results of these types of studies, because I think there's a lot of value and a lot of validity in them. But I still wear a skeptical hat when any study biases towards a very particular type of group that already does a lot of interesting brain stuff on the phone. Like what? You're correct. I agree. Yeah. The. The selected population of lucid dreamers so selective, and they already are probably profoundly different than non lucid dreamers in the way that their brain works during REM, right. But that they have to be lucid. In order for the study to work, then why don't you? Then maybe they should train. You could train to be a lucid dreamer. There are techniques that you could do to post right there that tells me their brains are different. Because if you have to go, is it introducing a training lucid or even induced sing? Lucid dreamers? Introducing an artifact? That's the question. That's what I'm saying. I'm not general to the or. We don't exactly to the can. We generalize from the lucid dreaming brain to just the regular dreaming brain? I don't know exactly. I mean, there's still in REM sleep. I mean, I think there's still a lot to be learned, but by that state, even if it is somewhat specialized. But in terms of people who have a natural facility for it or people that train for it, I think there's still a lot to be learned we just have to be clear that the lucid dreaming state is different than the regular dreaming state. It's two different States of mind, that's all. And we don't know what's closer are. You right. Right. Lucid dreaming to be being awake closer than lucid. Dreaming to regular dry, non lucid dreaming. We don't know that question. I don't think we could assume that lucid dreaming is more like non lucid dreaming that it is then being aware. Maybe you're mostly awake when you're lucid dreaming. Yeah. I mean, I'm all for this research. Obviously, it's a hybrid. I think there's. I think there's a lot. I think there's a lot that could come out of this. I mean, lucid dreaming is first off, it's fun as hell. The most fun I've ever had dreaming is when I've done. Lucid dreaming. It's amazing time. Secondly, you can do it. You could do things in your dream that you can't do in real life. Like therapy. You could practice. You could practice doing things in a dream that you might be too frightened to try when you're awake and you could actually build confidence in a dream to do something that you but maybe never would try when you were awake. Because you're just too. We don't know if that would work. The virtual exposure therapy doesn't really work. It works to some extent. Yeah, it depends. I mean, it's a build up to the real thing always. But I read that there was at least one study recently where they did the virtual exposure therapy. And it was his real exposure. I would guess it wouldn't be as good like. My assumption would be. It would require more trials. Or you might have to go more extreme in the virtual world than you would. Anyway, we're getting a little off the main course of discussion and we get to move on. Well, while we're going to take a quick break from our show to talk about our sponsor this week, Kiwi Kiwi co, they create Super cool hands on projects designed to expose kids of all ages to science, technology, engineering, art and math. Of course, in doing so, Kiwi co builds confidence, creativity, and critical thinking skills. We like critical thinking skills. Right, guys? Yes, we did. And each rate is designed by experts tested by kids and teaches a new concept along those lines. They're delivered monthly and they come with all the supplies needed for that month project, including kid friendly instructions and an enriching magazine with a lot of content to learn about that. Create them. Alright, guys, check this out. I'm gonna say two words. Fire lab. They have a fire lab. You ignite chemicals and see the colors of the combustion, which is really cool. The chemistry project contains everything to do seven different cool fire experiments. You're basically exploring the chemistry of combustion oxidation capillary action. It's just such a cool thing. And this is this particular one is for ages, 14 and up I think they made it actually specifically for me. I want to see things burn green with Kimi cos hands on art and science project projects. Kids can engineer a walking robot design of paint, pendulum conduct, bubbling chemistry, experiments, and engineer a walking robots also the comfort of home. Everything you need to make science, technology, engineering, art and math seriously fun delivered to your door stuff. Get 30% off your first month plus free shipping on any crate line with code skeptics that's 30% off of your first month at Kiwi co com skeptics. Alright, guys, Let's get back to the show. Bob, tell us about phage viruses and antibiotics. This was an interesting article I saw a little while ago and I haven't had a chance to talk about it. So researchers report in a study of a new surprising advance using viruses and antibiotics together to actually remove the antibiotic resistance of some superbugs, some bacteria. Bacterial, Super bugs. So this was fascinating partnership that was so cool. So this is published in nature microbiology earlier this year. Now we all know about the fight against superbugs. We've talked about it on the show a bunch. Now, these superbugs are bacterial strains that we have stupidly evolved faster than necessary to become huge, huge problems now and potentially devastating problems in the near future. I mean, we're talking worst case scenarios where humanity goes back to a pre antibiotic era. And when no antibiotics work at all, I mean, this is something that this is possible. And imagine you get a cut a little. It cut and you're like, Oh, crap. I hope this doesn't kill me. Imagine if that was a daily fear and something that needs to be taken seriously. So this takes me to a Senator Bomani, which is a bacteria. It's a superbug. This is one of the Super bugs I'm talking about. It's responsible for up to 20% of the infections in intensive care units. I'm sure a lot of people in the IC dealing with covert, not only are they dealing with covert, but they're also probably dealing with the Super bugs. A lot of them. And it's really insidious the superbug attaches to medical equipment like ventilator tubes and catheters. If you haven't infected wound, it's quite bad lungs. It infects your blood. It's absolutely horrible. And they call it a Super bug for a reason. It's really a Super. I mean, if the Marvel universe had superhero bacteria, this would be one of them. A Bomani. I would be one of them. It actually produces enzymes that nullify whole families of antibiotics. Bam. None of you were getting near me just because of these enzymes. And then if the antibiotic actually survives the enzymes, it doesn't get past it's. Sugar coating. And it actually is made out of sugars. This is a sticky, thick thing around the bacteria called the capsule and some of the strains of bacteria. Some strains of this bacteria can struggle off the strongest and most toxic antibiotics. No matter what we throw at it, nothing makes any difference for some of the strains of Ababa on. Now, the who says that it's a critical priority and we need new ways of treating this, and the CDC calls it an urgent threat. So we really got to start taking these seriously. So enter bacteria. Phages. Now, this is a virus, but not all viruses are like COVID. Some are our friends like this. Like this, the word bacteria phage itself means bacteria eater, and it's very apt. All they do is kill bacteria. That's all that these pages do. Just Google bacteria page right now. Look at it. They look like aliens. And there is my favorite virus for high and beyond. Right? So they look like an alien or some alien. Mech. I don't know. It's just. They're wonderful. So these were discovered over a century ago, but they lost favor when antibiotics came into power, right? We knew about them. I think we tried using it. I think the Soviet Union really used it a lot, and I think they may still use pages now. I mean, it's funny to think that if modern antibiotics were not discovered in that Petridis, we may very well have a whole infrastructure of infection care based on bacteria phages. Right now, it'd be really interesting to see how far that would have been taken in a century. But these phages are serious. I mean, the real toughest bacteria that laugh at people, they shit these little bacteria bricks when they see a phage because phages are very specific. Typically, one phage is meant for just one type of bacteria. It can get past only one type of bacteria's defenses, or maybe a very close family of one type of bacteria. Now, of course, that reminded me of the classic truck episode that would survive. Steve, Evan, I'm sure you remember that where an alien computer defends a planet by creating an image of a woman. Lyra I had to look that up to remember her name specific. Yeah, I look that one up to specifically kill one crew member, remember? She'd say, I am for you. Jim Kurt are the one and. And she couldn't kill anyone else. But if she touched, he was toast. So the researchers came up with a great plan. Their plan was really inspired. They found specific types of pages that could kill a Bamana. So they went to the areas like sewers and really like sewers and other nasty places where some of these pages are and so they got the virus and they got the pages and they threw them at Bomani, and most of them died as you would expect, because they're really tailored to kill this specific bacteria, but not all of them died. Some of the bacteria adapted to the phage and survived, and that was really problem. And, Yeah, that's a huge problem. But in this case, it was a fantastic opportunity, because when the researchers looked at those bacteria that survived. They saw something amazing. There was no longer a capsule that sticky outer coat was gone. So what the phage did was it realized that the bacteria realized that, Oh, damn, this page really needs the capsule to get inside, because that's how the phage gets past all the defenses of the bacteria. It basically has a key into the capsule. So the bacteria said, well, okay, I'll get rid of the capsule, and they no longer have the key. And that's exactly what happened when it shed it's. Sticky coating. The page was helpless. It couldn't gain entry into the bacteria. But that's where our antibiotics come in, because now, without that sticky outer coating of the capsule, now, our antibiotics can get in because the capsule that capsule was the thing that was preventing antibiotics from getting in that was actually the resistance. The armor that the bacteria developed over the years based on our antibiotics. So they would throw the phages at it, it would shed its capsule, and then the ones that survived had no capsule. Then they threw our antibiotics at, and they tested, like, nine or 10 different antibiotics. And I got varying numbers here, but probably something like seven of the antibiotics. Now, the resistance was gone. So what they did was they essentially reverted the antibiotic resistance by using the page and our most powerful antibiotics, one after the other, like a double tap. And it really, really worked. And this worked in animal studies, and they actually did some real world situations with people that had fatal infections, and it was successful. Now, I don't think this was a really huge study, but they did it on a handful of people, and it worked. So to me, this is a great new angle for dealing with Super bugs. You find the pages that are specifically tuned to that bacteria, you hit them with the pages, and then you hit them with the antibiotics. O. Once they've shed to the survivors so that they can get past the last defense that the phage couldn't. So it's a great way to temporarily kind of reverse this resistance that we've been accelerating the evolution of so pretty exciting. And I would like to see more phase use in the future because one of the benefits the phages have over antibiotics is that phages are so specific. Now, you've all heard of broad spectrum antibiotics, right? Yeah, that's great. But also because it's broad spectrum, you're killing a lot of the good bacteria. And you know, if you listen to the show, most of the bacteria around are really good. In fact, a lot of it in the human body is critical. You don't want to be messing with that. So anything that can be specifically targeting the really bad bacteria and sparing, the good stuff is great in my book. So. All right, Evan, I understand that Gweneth Paltrow has finally found a way to exploit the pandemic. Oh, Yes, the Queen of quackery, the Duchess of dubiousness, the matriarch of malarkey according to a recent blog post in which she is being pillared for correctly. So Gweneth Paltrow claims she had COVID 19 very early on. Apparently she's not specific with things like exactly when she had it, which is a little unusual when I speak to people who have had cover, they can tell me with precision when they tested positive for it. But that aside, Let's take her at a word. Well, here are some words from her directly from her advertised. I mean, her blog post the other day. These are her words I had COVID 19 early on and it left me with some long tail fatigue and brain fog. In January, I had some test done that showed really high levels of inflammation in my body. So I turned to one of the smartest experts I know in this space, the functional medicine practitioner Dr will coal. After he saw all my labs, he explained that this was a case where the road to healing was going to be longer than usual. We meaning she and the doctor had been doing a version of a protocol he outlines in his forthcoming book, intuitive fasting. It's a keto keto and plant based. Will also got me on supplements most of them in the service of a healthier gut there's, butyrate which will says, support healthy microbiome, and then in my daily Madam overeat supplement, I get fish oil, B vitamins, some vitamin D three selenium and zinc, all of which will says, are critical for me right now. I even get more zinc and selenium, along with the antioxidants vitamin C and resveratrol the resveratrol in my detox detoxifying Super powder, which I mix with water. All right, those are the highlights of the blog post. Wow. Yeah, Yeah. This is a shameless promotion, basically telling her readers to buy all sorts of Goop related and sponsored products, everything from including hiking, accessories, and an infrared sauna blanket that we talk about infrared saunas or Oh, Yeah, we didn't do well. It didn't take long for those skeptical of gwith to raise some keen observations about some of her comments. For example, there's Bruce Lee at Forbes. Yes, Bruce Lee. His name is Bruce Lee. Now, I don't believe anything you're saying. This name Bruce. Probably a good thing I don't believe anything she's saying. Here are some of his points she didn't specify which tests she took where the inflammation was occurring or what really high levels of inflammation even mean inflammatory inflammation is a very vague in general term. So did she go to a medical doctor who as actual knowledge of COVID 19? Is coal a COVID 19 expert? Has he done any research or published any scientific studies on COVID 19 while he searched the PubMed for coal and COVID 19 and nothing really came up. So Cole was originally trained as a chiropractor and on his website, he asks himself the questions are, are you a medical doctor to that? He responds, no, I do not practice medicine and do not diagnose or treat diseases or medical conditions. So isn't long Cove a medical condition? He asks. Yeah. So it's not clear what specific knowledge coal has regarding COVID 19. But he says my services are not meant to substitute or replace those of a medical doctor. So there's your sure trap door Disclaimer that you see with every good quack. There also functional medicine is both whether it's an MD or not functional medicine. If you just a quick definition of that, it's basically, like massively over interpreting lab results like testing for shit and saying some really hand waving explanation for what it means. But it's just another umbrella term for just non science based made up shit that I want to promote. So these are the people who will tell you that you have too much metal in your gut and you need to key late or too much fungus in your gut and then retry all of these drugs. And then you have like, draw line, thyroid dysfunction or normal. We the one. Take your pick. Oh, boy. I mean, there's so many relentless sort of attacks right now on Gweneth. And like I said, rightly. So Here's another small sample. I'll give you two more quick ones. Sarah fielding from very well mind com with much still being discovered about COVID 19 and it's short and long term effects. If breeding ground exists for misinformation and exploitation, the latest example comes from Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle site Goop. Yeah. Altro uses her COVID 19 experience is an opportunity to promote unsubstantiated detoxes and cleanses while plugging Goop brand products under the guise of relieving discomfort. Oh, Yeah, and he interviewed Tim Coffield. Timothy Coffield. Yeah, I had on the show before. He's a professor of health law and science policy at the University of Alberta, and he's probably done more research on kind of the damage that Gwyneth and group have done to Western society where Tim points out it's a good example of how misinformation is going to continue to be pushed out in the context of COVID 19, we often think of misinformation as the hoaxes or the or the conspiracy theories and antivax rhetoric. But there's also this kind of misinformation which is subtler and still trying to leverage this moment in time, trying to leverage the pandemic in order to sell products. Further, a Brander to even sell kind of an ideological position as to how we're supposed to be with our health. Absolutely correct. And a good observation by Tim. All right. Thanks, Evan. Yes, it's who's that noisy time. All right, guys, last week I played this noisy. All right, guys, any guesses on those sounds that you just heard? Go ahead. Alright, so to me, that sounds similar to the testing they did was back in the 70 s or 80 s for sound effects in which they took like metal screwdrivers and hit them against high tension lines up. That was bill Burr making sound effects for star Wars, the very first film. You are not incorrect and that it sounds exactly like that. Ok, good. But that's not it. I got a hint of classic star Trek episode cats PA. You know, with the home episode and the creatures at the end when their true form was revealed, they made these really surreal noises. I got a little bit of that. A little bit of hit of that. Oh, my God. As soon as you said star Trek body, my brain heard. Yes, I know exactly what you're talking about. Now, I have to go back and hear them. It's not that. Yes, but I know exactly. Is it ice thing? Oh, my God. Let's go through. What do people say here, Steve? All right, Let's go through. So, Jill Crookshanks, does that remind you of the bad guy? And that's the name of her mines? Cat. Yeah, that's Bines cat and Harry Potter are. But what was the name of the King from brave heart rate? Or what was the name of the King in that movie? Oh, King Edward Longshanks, Longshanks. Oh, God, I love that. Are what's your good job in that role? Okay. Anyway, this is from a listener named Joel Crookshanks, and she said, it sounds like someone playing Galaga in an arcade. You can hear the joystick and clearly the Blasters. Thanks. I'm like, you know, I kind of think she picked up something here that might be there. So I said, Yeah, I kind of hear that, but I want to hear what it sounds like. So I went and I listened to Galaga and I downloaded some sound effects from there that were as close to what she was saying, here, listen to this. Oh, my gosh. That brings back memories. All right, so it wasn't Galaga. But thank you so much, because just hearing the sounds, it always just makes me smile. And I can Warp myself back to when I was in there playing that game. So we got another guess from a listener named David Barlow, and he said, Hi, everyone. My guess is some sort of high tension cable snapping. Keep up the great work. So, Yeah. Evan, you're not alone. A lot of people guessed some type of cable. High tension cable. There were lots of guesses about the telescope crashing. This is not anything to do with a cable, but my God, does it sound like cables rattling against each other again? I've said this many times. That's why I love who's that noisy? Because bacon sounds like rain frying bacon. Everything sounds like something else, which I find remarkable. Now, here is the winning guest. This is from a listener named Logan Callen. He says, Hi, Jay. The noise from this week's. Who's that noisy? Is someone ice skating on a frozen body of water? It looks beautiful, but you wouldn't catch me on that ice. Now listen again. Now, to be fair, lots of SDU listeners guess correctly or mostly correctly on this one, ice makes this noise. If you throw a rock onto a frozen Lake under the right circumstances, it'll make that high but sounds, you know, but in this particular circumstance, we have an ice skater that's skating on a Lake where the ice is under pressure because it's something to think about the ice kind of like pushing out against the land. And it's like pushing back in on itself. So first, let me tell you about the person that created this. The person wrote, I made this sound recording of a frozen Lake in the winter of 2,005 or six in the area around Berlin. Frozen Lakes are known to give off most of the noise during major fluctuations in temperature. The ice expands or contracts and the resulting tension in the ice causes cracks to appear due to the changes in temperature. The hours of morning and evening are usually the best time to hear these sounds. And then he goes on to talk about the acoustic phenomena. He has an elastic type of sound, but another listener wrote in and gave a description of this. Glenn alert said, who's that known as the episode 815 of the ice cracking? He said, possibly due to a person skating. He was correct but was not the first. So he said the speed of a wave and a medium often depends on the frequency of the wave. This is known as dispersion in the some sound waves and ice to higher frequency waves travel faster than the lower frequency waves. This is the explanation for the PE the pup sounds, which are the higher frequency rate sounds and they arrive first. So you hear them first and then the low frequency sounds is like the EU that files is PPU, right? So Let's listen again. Cool. Yeah. So we have sounds being made and the higher frequencies get to you first because they move faster in the medium than the lower frequencies and it's a collection of sounds that makes that effect right. It's a really good analogy to sound effects and fully made in movies where they layer effects. So as an example, the Millennium Falcon engine sound of it starting up or having problems with the Warp drive and all that stuff is six or 7. Different sounds layer over each other to create the whole effect, which I find fascinating because an expert sound engineer can create these soundscapes from different things that become something else. And I think it relates to this idea that all sounds. A human voice is like cords being played. It's not one note. Our voices are made up of chords. Sounds are made up of collections of different kinds of sounds. Let's move on to this week's. New, noisy. All right, so there's a funny story here. So Charlie Ross has been a long time contributor support or patron of the show. We went out and gave a talk at Google many moons ago. Charlie set it up for us. We had a great time hanging out with him at Google. He gave us an awesome tour, and many times throughout the years, we've seen Charlie at conventions and everything. So Steve and I this past weekend are we are doing our game show. We premiered our game show. It's a very soft release. We're still testing and still improving the show. We have a ton of things that we're going to be improving on it. But we're very happy to announce that boomer versus boomer Zoomer com, if you're interested, is launched, and Charlie is, I'm monitoring the chat. Right. It's my job to monitor the chat while we're doing the show and I see Charlie, his name come up. So I read the chat real quick and he said, so he says, I have a bag of meat in my refrigerator that's labeled Jay's balls, and I took a screenshot, and I immediately texted it to Bob because I'm like, this is awesome. And I know Bob would laugh at that. And then I emailed Charlie and I'm laughing. So Charlie, it has a great sense of humor, and he's a great contributor, and he also sent in a really provocative sound this week that I thought was vaguely similar to this week sound. And I think why I was attracted to it, because it is vaguely similar a little bit, but it is very different things. So let me get to that real quick. So here is the sound that Charlie sent me. So what is that? I know like it what is going on? I know Kara, I had the same instinct. It made me uncomfortable. I know. Like, I feel like my dog would bark at that sound. Yeah. So there is a single answer to this. I know that you're hearing other stuff going on, and you could talk about that. But of course I'm talking about the high pitched noise that you hear in there. What is this sound? What's generating it? What's making it? Where is it coming from? If you have an answer, please email me. And if you have a cool sound that you heard, you can also email me at WT at the school skeptics guide org. All right, coming up, we have a great interview with Philip. Got. He is the philosopher that we talked about recently on the show in our discussion of the inverse gambler's fallacy and inferring the multiverse from the fine tuning problem, we have a very interesting discussion. This is actually only part of it. The full one hour unedited discussion that we have will be available to our premium members. If you want to skip ahead because you want to listen to the full version, then just go to the one hour 39 minute Mark that will take you to the end of the interview. But to everybody else, Let's go to that interview now, joining us now is Philip got. Phillip. Welcome to the skeptics guide. Brilliant. Thanks for having me. It's very Steve. Yeah. Thanks for joining me. So, Philip, you are a philosopher. You are the author of the book Galileo's error foundations for a new science of consciousness, which we were just talking about is probably. I'm going to have to interview you at a separate time about the whole consciousness HubHub. But the interview today is a follow up to a discussion that we had on the SGU recently about the multiverse and the fine to the alleged fine tuning problem and some of the logical claims surrounding that I talked a bit on the show about an article you had written. And I disagreed with your ultimate conclusion. Now, I think the goal of this conversation is to see if we could work out our differences. Basically, I want you to convince me that I'm wrong, not just show that I'm wrong, but convince me that I'm wrong because that's the tricky part. So why don't you just set the stage for us, tell us about the fine tuning issue and how you came to write this article. Yeah, okay, well, I'll do my best. That's a big, big order to persuade you, but I'll do my best. So the fine tuning is the surprising discovery of the last few decades that certain of the constants of basic physics, such as the strength of gravity and the mass of electrons in order for life to be physically possible, the values of those constants had to fall in a certain really narrow range. And that was quite surprising that in some way, of course, we always knew that our universe was compatible with the existence of life because we're alive. But we didn't know how balanced on a knife edge that was that in order for that to be a physical possibility, these constants had to be, as it's referred to finally tune, they had to have these very precise values. So it's a kind of interesting, surprising fact. Some people reacted and say, okay, we got lucky. Well, not more to say about it, but many scientists and philosophers. The last few decades, I've suggested that this is actually strong evidence pointing to some kind of multiverse so that the thought is if there are a huge number of universes, each with the constants in their physics, a little bit different. So in some gravities, a bit stronger and some, it's a bit weaker in some electrons are a bit heavier. And some they're a bit lighter. If there's enough variation, then it might become sort of statistically, highly likely, even perhaps inevitable. But one of the universe is going to fluke the right numbers to allow for the compatibility with intelligent life. So that's a thought. And then, I mean, I was really persuaded by that, but for a long time, actually. But I uncovered this work of certain probability theorists and losses of probability. It's actually a few decades old now. And I think it's part of the problem of things so specialized now that there's been this debate for decades, and it hasn't gone out of the narrow confines of theory of probability theory, even though there's such huge interest in these fine this issues among scientists and the general public. But anyway, the claim is that that inference from the fine tuning to the multiverse commits a kind of logical fallacy, we can actually identify what the fallacy is. And I thought about this for a long time. Read the literature around it. And Yeah, I'm actually quite persuaded that the claim is correct to you. Yeah. So my understanding of it is. And correct me from wrong is that whether or not there are many universes doesn't alter the probability of our universe being fine tuned for life? Yeah. So the basic accusation is what what's called the inverse gambler's fallacy? The inverted gambler's fallacy so that the regular gambler's fallacy that some listeners might be familiar with is where you've been playing the casino all night. You've had a terrible run of luck. You just keep your trying to roll a double six, and you just keep having terrible roles. But you think I'm going to have one more go, because I'm surely going to do well. Now, I'm surely going to roll a double six now because I do some good look. It would be really improbable if I roll badly all night. So given that I've rolled badly up to now, surely I'm going to roll. Well, now, well, of course, that's a fallacy, because any individual role, including your next one, has the same odd one in 36 if it's trying to get a double six. So no matter how long or how little you've been playing, the odds of getting a double six on the next role are exactly the same so that's the classic gambler's fallacy that everyone is agreed on. Now, the inverse gambler's fallacy goes like this, you walk into a casino, and you see, someone have an incredible role, Let's say, to make it more dramatic, they're playing a game where you've got to get sixes and they roll 20 dice, and all of them come up six. It's like, Oh, my God. And you think, Wow, what an incredible role. They must have been playing all night, because if they just had one role, then it's incredibly improbable. It get all sixes to 20 dice, so they must have been playing all night. And then it's more probable now that's a fallacy as well, because all you've observed is one role that's the only role you've observed. And as is the case in the original gamblers fallacy. The odds of of getting all sixes on that individual role is the same as for any other role. It doesn't matter if you've been playing all night or if that's your first role, the odds of getting all sixes is the same for any individual role. So for the same reasons, essentially, that's a fallacy as well. And the claim is that the multiverse theorist or at least someone arguing from fine tuning to the multiverse is essentially making the same committing the same fallacy. So they're saying, you know, look around that they this fine tuning phenomena in, Oh, my God, this is so improbable. There must be loads of other universes were the numbers didn't come up. Right. So our numbers flukey came up right in our universe. There must be loads of other universes where they didn't come up right. And so is it. The same fallacy? Because all we've observed is our universe. And seeing that the numbers came up right in our universe, no matter how much the other universes there are, it doesn't make it any more likely that our universe we'll have the right numbers just as when you've only seen one role. No matter how many times that guy's been playing tonight, it doesn't make it any more likely that that one role you saw is going to be an incredible one. So that's the basic idea. All right, so I understand and agree with that false that that is a fallacy completely get that my counter is that it doesn't apply to the situation. But let me finish setting up the background a little bit. So just for clarity, the fine tuning argument assumes that the constants of the universe will say are variable, that they don't have to be what they are. There's no other Meadow law that makes them what they are. So that's one assumption they also make you could make certain assumptions about what the probability distribution is. But one physicist said the probability of all the confidence being within the narrow range they would have to be in to allow for complex life is one in 10? To the 229, which is basically a gajillion. Right? We'll just call that a gajillion from this point forward. That's, like, almost zero. It's such a teeny, tiny, teeny tiny number, but that's a lot of assumptions going into that. I personally don't think those assumptions are warranted. I think that the answer probably is something else. But for the sake of this argument going forward, Let's say that the fine tuning premise of variability and that kind of distribution is roughly correct. And therefore, then that means the probability of our universe containing life being compatible with life is one in a kajillion. Right? Do you agree with that so far? Yeah, that's. And I agree. Also, there are lots of things one could question along the way. I mean, one thing is, the evidence could change with developing science, but I agree with the setup. Yeah, the thought experiment set it up. The thought experiment will assume for the logic, the statistical logic point of this, we'll assume that that's correct. Do you think it's likely there will be one universe compatible Le with life? Again, assuming the fine tuning assumptions, if there was one universe or if there's a kajillion universes. Yeah, it follows from the fine tuning. The probability of a universe compatible with life is very, very low. That's right. That's right. Yeah, but if there were many, many universes, Yeah, it would be more likely. Right. So this is one thing that there was because I wrote two blogs about this and there's been over 1 500 comments, which is a lot for my blog. And there seemed to be some debate about whether or not you were saying that the multiverse is even a solution to the fine tuning problem, which is different than saying we can infer the healthier fine tuning. And some were saying that you're saying that the multiverse wouldn't even solve the fine tuning problem, but wouldn't it? Alright, I see. I didn't know you had two blogs on it. I only saw one. I said it would have been good to. I'm sorry. There's a follow up. No. So Here's what I think. I think. If on independent evidence, we had independent evidence for a multiverse of the right kind, then I think the fine tuning problem would go away. And that's simply because that would change the probabilities, because it would no longer be very improbable. Right? And so some people say, well, isn't there independent evidence for a multiverse on? This is actually what I'm writing about in the academic paper I'm working on for this, which is on my website because actually, this philosophy discussion and probability theories discussions are going on for decades and no one's connected it up to the scientific discussion. And that's what I'm also trying to do. It's absolutely unbelievable. Everything's too specialized. I'm jealous of the sixteenth century when you could sort of now. Yeah, but although there is arguably, and this is all contentious tentative evidence, independent evidence for a multiverse. I don't think it's evidence for a multiverse of the right kind, but that's a separate question to when all we're observing is one fine tuned universe so that give a right to a multiverse. That's what I'm saying is fallacious. Yeah. Although that's why I think a lot of people have difficulty, including myself. Because if the multiverse, I put all empirical evidence and other independent arguments, aside just from purely logical point of view, if the multiverse solves the fine tuning statistical problem, then why can't. Why can't we at least say that? It's more likely that the multiverse is therefore more likely than one solitary universe? I just think these are two different things. I mean, we could look at it in terms of the theoretical reasons in terms of kind of Basin inference, or we could look at it just by analogies. I mean, maybe staff or analogies. I've given a lot of monkeys on typewriters analogies, so not going into the whole Joker thing. But, you know, if you wake up and there's a monkey on a typewriter typing, perfect English. Wow, that's weird. That needs explaining, but I don't think you would have the right to say, Oh, there must be loads of monkeys. There must be trillions of monkeys in different rooms in this building all riding rubbish. But if you started off knowing you were in a room with trillions, a building with trillions and trillions of monkeys, and Let's say the person who's monkey Roding ish was going to get woken up in that scenario. So, you know, then you'd say, okay, I just got lucky. Someone was going to get lucky. I got lucky. End of story. So I think that's the difference. So if you already know there's loads of monkeys on typewriters, the problem wouldn't arise. All right, so Here's where I think you're analogy is a little wrong. And I'm going to try to fix it. And I think if you agree with my fix, then our two approaches come together. So Here's been my problem. And I tried to articulate this, at least in one of my blog posts is that you're not adequately dealing with the selection process here because we are not existing in a random universe, we only could exist in a universe that is compatible with life. So, for example, I would argue in your gamblers analogy, a better analogy which has no selection at all, rather than walking up to a table and somebody rolls 26 is, I agree that's the inverted gamblers policy. Rather, Let's say you're blind, but you love gambling and you know how slot machines work. But you walk into a casino that you've never been to before. You have no idea how many slot machines there are. But you know that there's one on the kajillion chance that any slot machine will win. And you also know that Let's us say, make it more plausible that on average, any one slot machine will give a jackpot once a month. And it sends off a very specific jackpot alarm. When it does, you walk into a casino. And the moment you walk into a casino, you hear the jackpot alarm go off. Now, is it more likely that there's one slot machine in that casino? Or that there's 1,000 slot machines in that casino? Because you would hear any slot machine that hit the jackpot. I would think that this is where I think the rubber is going to meet the road. Which analogy is better in terms of your Joker monkey typewriter analogy. Here's my fix, because I think you're trying to fix the selection process there because you only get woken. You only get to waken to whatever woken up if your monkey types English within whatever the 10 minute time frame. But you existed before that experiment. And you're still being biased by considering the probability of you winning, which I think is the lottery fallacy. I think that the application of the inverse gambler's fallacy to the multiverse problem is an example of the lottery fallacy because it's not adequately dealing with the selection process. Again, this is my understanding. Please convince me if I'm wrong. So this is how I would fix your Joker analogy. Let's say the Joker is actually Loki, right? The God, the Norse God. Loki. I know we're mixing or in DC. Yeah, we'll match those up. And so he has godlike powers. And what he actually did was he had a monkey in front of a typewriter. And if that monkey types English in 10 minutes, he will create a person out of nothing. So that person gets magicked into existence. Now you wake up, you pop into existence in this room. And Loki is sitting there. And he says, you can ask me anything about what's happening in this room. But you can't ask me anything about what's happening beyond this room. And you say, okay, what's that? It's a typewriter. How does it work? Fine. What's? This creature explains monkeys and what they can do and what they can't do. He explains the whole setup. And when you fully understand the setup and you realize how magnificently improbable it is, that that monkey type. I like yellow bananas. Would it be reasonable for you to infer that Loki has a kajillion rooms with monkeys and typewriters? And you, you are the one who was magic into existence because your room is the one where the monkey Typed English. Wouldn't that be reasonable? So in your scenario, you imagining whichever monkey on typewriter, Typed English, you would have been saved. Or you imagine some person would have been magic into existence. So that person would. That individual would be incredibly improbable. But that someone got magic into existence would be probable. If there's a kajillion monkeys, it would be incredibly improbable. If there's one monkey and one typewriter. Isn't that fair? So I think there are two different things here. We need to distinguish the problem with it. We've got two analogies. So just take each of them in turn. So the one you started with the slot machine and you go in and one of the slot machine, whichever slot machine goes off wins the jackpot, the alarm goes off. And then your thought is you've got good reason to think there must have been lots of slot machines than just one. Because then it's more likely. So I agree. In that case, you certainly do have evidence. There are more people playing on the slot machines. But what is this analogous about that case to fine tuning is that there's a kind of mechanism there that ensures that whoever wins in the whole casino, you're going to hear about it? Yeah. And I don't think that's analogous to the fine tuning. So this is what Roger white wrote. The key paper on this pointed out he said that would be analogous to the following kind of scifi example where we were once disembodied spirits floating through the multiverse, looking for a finetuned universe. And then when we find it, we slip into it. Now, in that scifi scenario, whichever universe turns out to be fine tuned. We're going to observe it. And in that scenario, I think that's analogous to your slot machine example. Yeah, we would have evidence. But that's not our universe in our universe. There is no such mechanism. All we know. But all we observe is. Is our universe. And our universe just had one shot of its numbers come in. If another universe, a few dollars down was fine tuned. There would be no mechanism to allow us to observe that. No, that I think. But there would be people in that universe who would observe it. So I think you're just moving the lottery fallacy one step back again. I don't have to be the person observing it. It's just that if whatever universe is compatible with life, life will evolve. And the life in that universe will observe their own universe. So I agree that the casino analogy isn't perfect. But I'm trying to fix your analogy. Or whoever's analogy that is, I wouldn't come up with that analysis to. I still think I'm correct. But I think you're right. It's confusing. So Let's go to the Loki. Victor, no, I think that's for sure. Because in that there is no outside Observer. You get magicked into existence. You have no prior existence. Once you understand the rules of the room, you find yourself in. You realize that your existence is fantastically improbable. And isn't it reasonable and logical and not a fallacy? To say Loki must have a kajillion monkeys out of kajillion typewriters. And if any one of them was successful, somebody would have been magicked into existence in that room and found themselves to be an highly improbable event. Yeah, I guess. I guess my intuitions go the opposite way there. So that was why I objected the other analogy. But coming back to what you're focusing on, I guess, is another point. A lot of people have draw. My attention is the pre existence case. So the worry and the Joker cases you already exist. So we've got a focus for your attention. So I actually came up with my own analogy to try and get around this. Let me tell you that. And then Let's see if you have different intuitions than in the local case. And then we could try and work out. I'm not trying to Dodge the local case. We could try and work out what's going on here. So I thought, I suppose I'm the product of IVF. My conception came about through IVF. And then suppose as an adult, I discover that the doctor who did the IVF made a kind of sick joke. They decided that they were going to roll 20 dice to decide whether to fertilize the egg. And they were only going to fertilize the egg if all 20 dice came up stickers right. And they did. And they fertilize the egg. Right. So I discovered the existence that this depended on this kind of problem event. Now, does that give me reason to think so. It's kind of like the joke case. You could say it's. The Joker. Does that give me reason to think the doctor's done this quite a lot? I mean, you might think what he did it once. You might have done it again. But the fact that I've discovered that my conception depended on this improbable event as kind of all conception does doesn't seem to me to give me any reason to think the doctor did it many times. What do you think about that one that analogous to the fine tuning case? We discovered that our existence depends on this improbable event. But that doesn't give us a reason to think, Oh, there must be lots of other universes where the numbers didn't come up right doesn't rub me the right way. I think there's details in there that are distracting from the core logic. But the first I'm hearing of it. So I'm trying to wrap my head around it. So if you Let's say he had to roll 1,000 dice and they all had to come up with sixes, Let's just make those statistics more intuitive. So I would have a problem thinking that that was a one off random event because it's just so close to zero in probability. But that's if you strip it down, it's like, Yeah, for anyone for there to be. Let's say anyone born of IVF and the doctor had to roll those dice and come up all sixes. And you're the IVs success. You'd say, Yeah, that probably happened a lot of times for there to be anyone again. I think the lottery fallacy is thinking about. And I think you agreed with us when we were sort of pre game in this a little bit. The lottery fallacies when you think what's the probability of me existing, which, Yes, it's fabulously unlikely versus the probability of anyone existing. So the probability that our universe exists with the fine tuned parameters is extremely low, but that the probability of any universe existing with the fine tuned parameters is could be very high. If there's a multiverse and anyone who evolved in that universe would be lucky and would see themselves as the recipient of a fabulously unlikely event. But because there's that selection process being that person doesn't require special explanation that it actually isn't a low probability event. If there's a multiverse, if you ask it correctly, what's the probability of anybody existing any finetuned universe? Anyone into existence by Loki? Anyone being the product of IVF? Anyone winning the lottery? It's fine to me that's what it ultimately comes down to. The lottery fallacy is certainly a fallacy, but there are just different lottery cases. What goes on in the standard lottery case again is no matter who wins, you're going to know about it because you're going to see it on TV. So the media provides a mechanism such that ensures that whoever's going to win, you're going to know about it but anything like that, I think, is not analogous to fine tuning. I agree. I agree. That's why. But if you have a cosmic lottery like the guard lottery and whoever wins the lottery gets magicked into existence, that's the fine tuning. The question is, and I think we're agreeing on this. The question is, how we should construe the evidence of fine tuning should we say our universe is fine tuned or our universe is fine tuned. And this is a deep problem in theoretical probability about how it's permissible to construe the evidence. And I think we can both agree that there are some lottery cases where you shouldn't take your evidence to be somebody won the lottery. The lottery case where you've just played the lottery for the first time, you put your numbers in and you don't watch the TV, you don't read the newspaper. You wouldn't know if anyone want unless it was you. And you win. So I think it's pretty straightforward in that case that you don't have any reason to think lots of people played the lottery. All you know is you want your numbers came up. And no matter how many people played, it doesn't make it any more likely that your numbers would come up. So I think we can both agree that I think this is pretty uncontentious, that in that case, your evidence shouldn't be. Someone won the lottery. Your evidence is I won the lottery. But that doesn't apply. The question is, what is the fine tuning situation analogous to that or analogous to something else? And it seems pretty clear to me, it's analogous to that unless you're worried about pre selection. But then we can move to the IVF case. And I think, I mean, we just have to work out. We'll look through it. We could also wide offer some theoretical principles that are slightly more complicated about what we could have talk about. But I would just say that the IVF analogy is closest to the fine tuning cases. Think about my loci analogy. Really? Really think about that? And the other thing about the IBS case? Absolutely case. But the ultimate lesson here again, whichever one of us is construing this correctly, does it matter? In my opinion, absolutely. What matters is the point of all, this is actually how damn difficult and counterintuitive statistics or rains are not real. All optimized for this kind of thinking. I cannot wrap my head around why my position is not correct. And I guess I haven't been able to explain my position to you. You haven't been able to explain your position to me in a way that is ultimately compelling. There's some bit of logic that's separating us that we have not been able to identify. And because this is damn counterintuitive. Absolutely. We can agree on that. I'm I'm a philosopher. I mean, this is what it's like all the time that we just somehow can't manage to persuade each other on these issues, but it's having the conversations. And I think you make progress by developing the difference, even if you don't ultimately persuade the other person. And that's what it's all about, I think. Okay, well, thank you so much for having this conversation with me. I definitely want to get you back on the show at some point to talk about consciousness. That's your area of expertise, and I'm in an area where I'm very interested in it as well. So thanks for joining us. And Yep. And hopefully we'll have you back some time. Thanks a lot, Steve. I really enjoy this conversation. Speaking, it's time for science or fiction. Each week I come up with three science news items or Fax too real. And one sake, that challenge my panel is skeptic. Tell me which one is the fake. We have another theme this week, and we've been doing the show on Tuesdays because of Cara schedule. Recenter and, well, there's fewer news items to choose from is having a hard time. So I'm doing a lot of themes while we're doing our Tuesday shows, and then we are suffering the consequences. Yes, that's exactly it's all your fault care. So the theme this week is agriculture. Stats, statistics, agriculture. Okay, you guys ready? Oh, item number 1 90% of farms in the United States are considered small farms representing 52% of farmland or number two globally, 28% of the world's population works in agriculture and number. 3, 75% of the world's food comes from just five plants go first. All right, the first one. Steve, you said 90% of farms in the us are considered small farms representing 52% of farmland. I mean, that seems to make a lot of sense that, like 90% of the farms would be small, but I think that my gut is telling me that they don't represent half the farmland. So that's my gut telling me that right there, the second one globally, 28% of the world's population works in agriculture. That seems to be about right. So roughly a quarter of the world's population is working in agriculture to feed the world. I think that sounds right. And 75% of the world's food comes from just five plants. This is one of those ones where I'm like, I'm pretty damn sure that this is correct. It's really the number. I mean, I would think that if there's any change to this, it would even be higher. Might be 90% of the world's food comes from five plants. Okay, I'm going to go out on a limb here because my gut was telling me to go with the first one. But I'm going to say that the 75% of the world's food comes from just five plants. It's higher than 75% okay. Evan, Yeah, good points. Jay of farms in the us are considered small farms, and it's. It represents of farm land. Yeah, I suppose so. I wish I kind of knew what a small farm was, by definition, but I don't think there's any problem with that. Well, I'll tell you. Thank you. After you give me your answer. Of course. What during the reveal, I will give you an operational definition of what is considered a small firm globally to a second one globally 28%. Of the world's population works in agriculture is of 2,000,000,000 people working in agriculture. It's a lot. But when you take India and China into account. Yeah, right. I mean, I do have to think about if you're going to go with this statistic, you have to figure out what they are doing is India have that much agriculture? I mean, Gee whiz, they just don't have that much land. And is it agriculture? Oh boy, that one's tricky. But as Jay said, 75% of the world's food comes from just five plants. Ry, sweet. What else? Just two plants. 2 plants, all of the world's food. I'll go with Jay. I think he made some good points which I don't refute. And it sounds solid to me. I'm with a 75% of the world's food fiction. Okay? Bob 28% of the world's population works. I can make an argument in my head either way. So I'm just going to just go with my gut and say that number one that 52% of the United States farm lander from small farms. It just seems too high. 90% maybe I could buy, but not 52% I'll say that's fiction. Okay. And Kara, so it's between the one and 3 from what you guys answered. So 28% of the world's population works in agriculture, I buy it for sure. 90% of the farms in the us are small representing 52% of farm land. Well, that would make sense, right? Because if they're small, more of them will take up the same amount of space as 10% potentially of industrial AG farms. I think that I buy that a lot of people grow their own food. A lot of people do local farming and community farming. And then there's probably not that many big massive industrial AG farms that have cornered the market. So that one seems likely to me, the 75 of the world's food coming from just five plants seems very unlikely to me, mostly because I'm not questioning that we don't have a lot of biodiversity and our food sources. It probably is only like five plants. But Where's the animal protein of the world's food you're saying is completely plant based and I don't buy that people eat too much meat and fish and fish. Yeah. I mean, I kind of meant fish with meat. But you're right, too much animal protein. Obviously it is true that in poorer countries I do think that plants probably make up more of the diet, but I still think that in rich countries where people eat a lot of meat that's going to muscle into that 25% figure. So I'm going to say that one's a fiction because Where's the beef? Alright, do you all agree in number two globally 20 of the world's population works in agriculture. It's more than a quarter of people on the planet are just growing food. You guys all think that one is science and that one is science. That is correct. At least that was the figure as of 2,018, which is the most recent figure I could find originally actually found references that said, but I when I did drive like, Yeah, that was true in 90. Whoa. It's changed that much. Yeah, it drops to 44% to 28% from 19 91 to 3,018 at least 30. What's the percentage in the United States that works in agriculture? Yeah, it's still going to be pretty high because there are a lot of farm workers. Unfortunately, 1% on that was 5-7-I was going to say, Unfortunately, probably a lot of them are undocumented. Okay, once you said no, it's true. So I do wonder how much they actually show up on censuses. Yeah. See, I don't know if that 1% includes undocumented workers. I'd probably there's an estimation of it. There's a massive de point. Is there's a huge difference between developed Nations and developing Nations? It could be as high as 69% in, like, the Democratic Republic of Congo that's the figure and 1% in the us and then it averages out to 28%, but because they're mostly doing subsistence for. Yeah, okay. Yeah. A lot of that is it's also just because it's just not as efficient, you know, Let's go back to number. 1. 90% of farms in the us are considered small farms representing 52% of farmland. Bob, you think this one is the fiction everyone else thinks this one is science. So even let me give you that definition for you. First of all, in order to be considered a farm, you need to be selling a thousand dollars worth of agricultural products a year or you would have under normal conditions. If you like whatever you get wiped out or something, you're still a farm. But if you grew enough food that you would have made a thousand dollars selling what you produce, then if you don't sell any food like if you're substances form, you don't count as a what if you're a community guard? A community farm where you don't sell it, but you're actually growing it for lots and lots of people? I don't know. I know the USDA definition. A small farm makes less than 350,000 dollars a year. So that's a very specific so it's all based on how much money you produce by farming, not how much can you produce system? Big change there. Yeah. So if you have a farm, costs are so high. Yeah, that's great. You might make 300 Groschen 300. Yeah. So gross income less than 350 and 90% of the farms fall into that category and they represent 52% of the farmland. So that is science, but they produce only 26% of the food. So what does that mean? They're half as productive as the other 10%. That makes sense. Well, that or they are also could just be more sustainable that's nonsequitor, even if there are more so and who can be very efficient and productive, but in doing so completely extract everything out of the land, it's still twice as productive. The reason is separate from the fact it's twice productive in the moment. Not necessarily. You know what long term. So, I mean, sustainability is a very interesting question and it's complicated. But don't assume that large farms are not sustainable. I'm not as in it. They have to grow food year to year too. They do, but they have a lot of tools at their disposal to do so very good. They just replace everything. The only issue is with leasing farms where you lease land for a number of years. Because then you don't care about the sustainability as much. If you own the land, you bought it to be sustainable, nobody could survive by destroying their own land. That is the source of their income. So sustainability is sort of an issue that everyone again, except unless you're leasing somebody else's land for a few years. And then you're leaving. But other than that model, sustainability is not this black and white thing because we're just talking about farmland, not pasture, which is just farmland. Yeah. This is not pass. And then the other 10%. The large farms are mostly family farms, but they're large scale family farms. They represent 2.5% of the farms, but it counts for more than of the produce. Oh, Wow. Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, that's surprising, actually. Yeah. So that's good. Number. 3 75. Of the world's food comes from just five plants. So, Kara J and Evan, you thought this was fiction. This is the fiction. But who's correct? Is it more than or is it more than just five plans? Definitely more. I think it's more than five plants, but I definitely think there's meat. There's gotta be meat that eats up more person or persons who are correct. Here is Kara cars. Correct. So you're right. I lift it up the meat. So actually, the truth is 75% of the world's food comes from 12 plants and five animals. So it's animals. Really? Yeah. Not like just three of them. That does. That makes sense. Yeah. If you take the 12 most important crop plants and the five most productive animal species that represents 75% of the calories that humans consume, it's still impressive, but I just made it like crazy and got rid of the animals. That was the big, tall, so character key and all that. So that's still a lot of times you should forget about in the U. K. We don't know that much, but a lot of countries eat exactly. Yeah. If there was a chicken. Cows, goats, sheep, pigs. Right. Pigs, pigs. Yeah. Pigs. So I think that's a lot. That's not a lot of biodiversity for 75% of our food. Think about that just 12 plants and 12 plants of five animals. And I guess that's based on where you live in the us wheat, so much corn and in certain parts of the world, they ate so much rice or they so much of a certain type of wheat. Yeah, those are the big three staple crops, corn, rice, wheat. But there's also again, 40% of the world population relies heavily on a staple bananas. Plantain like bananas like starchy Banas. Potatoes are another one. Think about potatoes, such a huge staple crop. And then there's lots of beans and lentils and things. Other things you have to mix in there. So, Yeah, that produces is responsible for a lot of the calories that we eat. And also we've developed Nations that are part of the global economy. We get a very distorted view because we do have a diverse diet, but a lot of parts of the world where their food and secure. They eat the same thing every day. You know what I mean? Like, they're really, really relying. They have overwhelmingly rely on a very narrow set of food, right. We totally take our food for granted here. Absolutely. All right. Good job, guys. That was a tough one. Yeah. Evan, give us a quote. This quote comes with a bit of a backstory. So I'll give you the quote first. And then I'll tell you the little story. What is the capital of North Dakota? That is a quote from Groucho Marx. Now, what time to get it right? Okay. I instantly recognized that story when you absolutely you know that legend there? We all made in skeptical. Lord, this is pre Cara days that he heard about it. All right, Kara, you know who Groucho Marx was? A I do. Okay, I got Mark's brother's, brilliant comedian. And whatnot it was friends with Dick have. Do you remember who Dick Cavett was? I remember the name television television show, especially popular in the 60 s and 70 s. Dick have. It wrote in the year. 2,070 wrote an article about Groucho Marx, and I told a story that Groucho was involved with. And I'll give you the highlights, basically, of that story back then. And he was referring to many years prior when Groucho was still doing stage performances. Among other things, there was a prominent trans medium holding forth and her devoted disciples solemnly offered to take the man born Julius Mark that's Groucho with them to a seance. Always intellectually curious. Groucho was glad to be asked along, though he told me, this is Groucho telling telling Dick habit that was vaguely insulted when his new friend solemnly cautioned him to show the proper reference. He replied, I'm not a clown 24 hours, he said, I can also be serious. The seance was held in the darkened parlor of some wealthy believers apartment. Groucho reported a heavy air of sanctity about the place and not entirely from the incense. Lights were low and the faithful conversed in hushed tones the medium began to chant unintelligibly and then to emit a strange humming sound eventually achieving her trance state, she says I am in touch I'm in touch with the other side she intoned does anyone have a question? Groucho rose and asked what is the capital of North Dakota? He recalled being chased for several blocks, but escaped injury? Yes. So that quote definitely comes from the famous Groucho Marx incident, incident of him attending the seance and supposed to sleep? This is what was said, which is brilliant and who knows about the chase for several blocks thing? But it is so perfectly Groucho and absolutely stabbing them in the eye figuratively when it came right to it. Does anyone have a question? What is the meaning of life? What's the capital of North Dakota that came over? Yeah. Classic. That's funny. Yeah, she knows all seasonal that's right. As long as you ask a vague subjective question, Brian.
